          Chemical Reaction s and Equations1 CHAPTER Consider the following situations of daily life and think what happens when – 

- milk is left at room temperature during summers. 
- an iron tawa/pan/
- nail is left exposed to humid atmosphere. 
- grapes get fermented. 
- food is cooked. 
- food gets digested in our body. 
- we respire. In all the above situations, the ature and the identity of the initial substance have somewhat changed. W e have alr eady learnt about physical and chemical changes of matter in our previous classes. Whenever a chemical change occurs, we can say that a chemical reaction has taken place. You may per haps be wondering as to what is actually meant by a chemical reaction. How do we come to know that a chemical reaction has taken place? Let us perform some activities to find the answer to these questions. Figure 1.1Figure

1.1 CHEMICALEQUATIONTIONS": "Activity 1.1 can be described as when a magnesium ribbon is burnt in oxygen, it gets converted to magnesium oxide. This description of a chemical reaction in a sentence form is quite long. It can be written in a shorter form. The simplest way to do this is to write it in the form of a wordequation. The wordequation for the above reaction would be 

Magnesium + Oxygen Magnesium
 oxide (1.1) (Reactants) (Product) The substances that undergo chemical change in the reaction (1.1), magnesium and oxygen, are the reactants. The ew substance is magnesium oxide, formed during the reaction, as a product. A wordequation shows change of reactants to products through an arrow placed between them. The reactants are written on the lefthand side (LHS) with a plus sign (+) between them. Similarly, products are written on the righthand side (RHS) with a plus sign (+) between them. The arrowhead points towards the products, and shows the direction of the reaction.You must have observed that magnesium ribbon bur s with a dazzling white flame and changes into a white powder . This powder is magnesium oxide. It is formed due to the reaction between magnesium and oxygen pr esent in the air .  Chemical Reactions and Equations 

31.1.1 W riting a Chemical Equation Is there any other shorter way for representing chemical equations? Chemical equations can be made more concise and useful if we use chemical formulae instead of words. A chemical equation represents a chemical reaction. If you recall formulae of magnesium, oxygen and magnesium oxide, the above wordequation can be written as 

Mg + O2 MgO
 (1.2) Count and compare the umber of atoms of each element on the LHS and RHS of the arrow. Is the umber of atoms of each element the same on both the sides? If yes, then the equation is balanced. If not, then the equation is unbalanced because the mass is not the same on both sides of the equation. Such a chemical equation is a skeletal chemical equation for a reaction. Equation (1.2) is a skeletal chemical equation for the bur ing of magnesium in air .",
        "

1.1.2 Balanced Chemical Equations": "Recall the law of conservation of mass that you studied in Class IX; mass can either be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction. That is, the total mass of the elements present in the products of a chemical reaction has to be equal to the total mass of the elements present in the reactants. In other words, the umber of atoms of each element remains the same, before and after a chemical reaction. Hence, we eed to balance a skeletal chemical equation. Is the chemical Eq. (1.2) balanced? Let us learn about balancing a chemical equation step by step. The wordequation for Activity 1.3 may be represented as Zinc + Sulphuric acid  Zinc sulphate + Hydrogen The above wordequation may be represented by the following chemical equation 

Zn + H2SO4 ZnSO4 + H2(1

1 H 2 S 1 O 4 As the umber of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of the arrow, Eq. (1.3) is a balanced chemical equation. Let us try to balance the following chemical equation

3 H 2 O 1 4 To equalise the umber of atoms, it must be remembered that we cannot alter the formulae of the compounds or elements involved in the reactions. For example, to balance oxygen atoms we can put coefficient ‘4’ as 4 H2O and not H2O4 or (H2O)4. Now the partly balanced equation become s Fe   +   4 H2O     Fe3O4   +   H2 Step IV Step IVStep IV ::: :: Fe and H atoms ar e still not balanced. Pick any of these elements to proceed further . Let us balance hydr ogen atoms in the partly balanced equation. To equalise the umber of H atoms, make the umber of molecules of hydrogen as four on the RHS.Step III: Step III:Step III:Step III:Step III:      It is often convenient to start balancing with the compound that contains the maximum umber of atoms. It may be a reactant or a product. In that compound, select the element which has the maximum umber of atoms. Using these criteria, we select Fe3O4 and the element oxygen in it. There are four oxygen atoms on the RHS and only one on the LHS. To balance the oxygen atoms The equation would be Fe   +   4   H2O     Fe3O4   +   4 H2Atoms of Atoms ofAtoms of In reactantsIn reactantsIn reactants In productsIn productsIn products oxygen oxygenoxygen (i)Initial 1 (in H2O) 4 (in Fe3O4) (ii)To balance 1×4 Atoms of Atoms ofAtoms of In reactantsIn reactantsIn reactants In productsIn productsIn products hydrogenhydrogenhydrogenhydrogenhydrogen (i)Initial 8 (in 4 H2O) 2 (in H2) (ii)To balance 8 2 × 4(1.6) (partly balanced equation) (1.7) (partly balanced equation)  Chemical Reactions and Equations 5To equalise Fe, we take three atoms of Fe on the LHS. 3   Fe   +   4   H2O     Fe3O4   +   4   H2(1.8) Step VI: Step VI:Step VI: Step VI:Step VI:  Finally, to check the correctness of the balanced equation, we count atoms of each element on both sides of the equation.

 The umbers of atoms of elements on both sides of Eq. (1.9) are equal. This equation is ow balanced. This method of balancing chemical equations is called hitandtrial method as we make trials to balance the equation by using the smallest whole umber coefficient. Step VII: Step VII: Step VII: Step VII: Step VII: W WW WWriting Symbols of Physical Statesriting Symbols of Physical States   Car efully examine the above balanced Eq. (1.9). Does this equation tell us anything about the physical state of each reactant and product? No information has been given in this equation about their physical states. To make a chemical equation more informative, the physical states of the reactants and products are mentioned along with their chemical formulae. The gaseous, liquid, aqueous and solid states of reactants and products are represented by the notations (g), (l), (aq) and (s), respectively. The word aqueous (aq) is written if the reactant or product is present as a solution in water . The balanced Eq. (1.9) becomes 

3Fe(s) + 4H2O(g) Fe3O4(s) + 4H2(g)
 (1.10) Note that the symbol (g) is used with H2O to indicate that in this reaction water is used in the form of steam. Usually physical states are not included in a chemical equation unless it is ecessary to specify them. Sometimes the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, catalyst, etc., for the reaction are indicated above and/or below the arrow in the equation. For example CO(g) + 2H (g)2340atmCHOH(l)3   (1.11) 6CO (aq) 12H O(l) C H O (aq) 6O2 2 6 12 6 + +Su light Chlorophyll 2 (aq) 6H O(l)+ (1.12) (Glucose) Using these steps, can you balance Eq.

 (1.15) (ii)Formation of water from H2(g) and O2(g) 
2H2(g) + O2(g) 2H2O(l)
 (1.16) In simple language we can say that when two or more substances (elements or compounds) combine to form a single product, the reactions are called combination reactions. In Activity 1.4, we also observed that a large amount of heat is evolved. This makes the reaction mixture warm. Reactions in which heat is released along with the formation of products are called exothermic chemical reactions. Other examples of exothermic reactions are (i)Burning of atural gas CH4(g) + 2O2 (g) CO2 (g) + 2H2O (g) (1.17) (ii)Do you know that respiration is an exothermic process? We all know that we eed ener gy to stay alive. W e get this ener gy from the food we eat. During digestion, food is broken down into simpler substances. For example, rice, potatoes and bread contain carbohydrates. These carbohydrates are broken down to form glucose. This glucose combines with oxygen in the cells of our body and provides energy. The special ame of this reaction is respiration, the process of 
C6H12O6(aq) + 6O2(aq) 6CO2(aq) + 6H2O(l) + energy
 (1.18) (Glucose) (iii) The decomposition of vegetable matter into compost is also an example of an exothermic reaction. Identify the type of the reaction taking place in Activity 1.1, where heat is given out along with the formation of a single product. Do Y ou Know?A solution of slaked lime produced by the reaction 1.13 is used for whitewashing walls. Calcium hydroxide reacts slowly with the carbon dioxide in air to form a thin layer of calcium carbonate on the walls. Calcium carbonate is  formed after two to three days of whitewashing and gives a shiny finish to the walls. It is interesting to note that the chemical formula for marble is also CaCO3.

- Heat the boiling tube over the  flame  of a burner or spirit lamp as shown in Fig. 1.4.

Y ou can also smell the characteristic odour of bur ing sulphur . 2FeSO4(s) Heat   Fe2O3(s)  +  SO2(g)  + SO3(g) (1.19) (Ferrous sulphate)   (Ferric oxide) In this reaction you can observe that a single reactant breaks down to give simpler products. This is a decomposition reaction. Ferrous sulphate crystals (FeSO4, 7H2O) lose water when heated and the colour of the crystals changes. It then decomposes to ferric oxide (Fe2O3), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and sulphur trioxide (SO3). Ferric oxide is a solid, while SO2 and SO3 are gases. Decomposition of calcium carbonate to calcium oxide and carbon dioxide on heating is an important decomposition reaction used in various industries. Calcium oxide is called lime or quick lime. It has many uses one is in the manufacture of cement. When a decomposition reaction is carried out by heating, it is called thermal decomposition.

During this reaction (1.29), the copper(II) oxide is losing oxygen and is being reduced. The hydrogen is gaining oxygen and is being oxidised. In other words, one reactant gets oxidised while the other gets reduced during a reaction. Such reactions are called oxidationreduction reactions or redox reactions.

- A chemical equation is balanced so that the umbers of atoms of each type involved in a chemical reaction are the same on the reactant and product sides of the equation. Equations must always be balanced. 
- In a combination reaction two or more substances combine to form a ew single substance. 
- Decomposition reactions are opposite to combination reactions. In a decomposition reaction, a single substance decomposes to give two or more substances. 
- Reactions in which heat is given out along with the products are called exothermic reactions. 
- Reactions in which energy is absorbed are known as endothermic reactions. 
- When an element displaces another element from its compound, a displacement reaction occurs. 
- Two different atoms or groups of atoms (ions) are exchanged in double displacement reactions. 
- Precipitation reactions produce insoluble salts. 
- Reactions also involve the gain or loss of oxygen or hydrogen by substances. Oxidation is the gain of oxygen or loss of hydrogen. Reduction is the loss of oxygen or gain of hydrogen. EXERCISES 1.Which of the statements about the reaction below are incorrect?

2 CHAPTER You have learnt in your pr evious classes that the sour and bitter tastes of food are due to acids and bases, respectively, present in them. If someone in the family is suffering from a problem of acidity after overeating, which of the following would you suggest as a remedy lemon juice, vinegar or baking soda solution? 

- Which property did you think of while choosing the remedy? Surely you must have used your knowledge about the ability of acids and bases to ullify each other’s effect. 
- Recall how we tested sour and bitter substances without tasting them. You alr eady know that acids ar e sour in taste and change the colour of blue litmus to red, whereas, bases are bitter and change the colour of the red litmus to blue. Litmus is a atural indicator , turmeric is another such indicator . Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth becomes reddishbrown when soap, which is basic in ature, is scrubbed on it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of water . You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and phenolphthalein to test for acids and bases. In this Chapter , we will study the r eactions of acids and bases, how acids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting things that we use and see in our daytoday life. Do Y ou Know?Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to the division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator . When the litmus solution is either acidic or basic, its colour is purple. There are many other atural materials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as Hydrangea , Petunia  and Geranium , which indicate the presence of acid or base in a solution. These are called acidbase indicators or sometimes simply indicators.  182.1 2.1 2.12.1UNDERST UNDERSTUNDERST ANDING THE CHEMICANDING THE CHEMICANDING THE CHEMIC AL PROPERTIES OFAL PROPERTIES OFAL PROPERTIES OF ACIDS AND BASESACIDS AND BASESACIDS AND BASES",

The electric current is carried through the acidic solution by ions. Acids contain H+ ion as cation and anion such as C l in HCl, N O3 in HNO3, SO2 4 in H2SO4, CH3COO in CH3COOH. Since the cation present in acids is H+, this suggests that acids produce hydrogen ions, H+(aq), in solution, which are responsible for their acidic properties.

2.5 Warning sign displayed on containers containing concentrated acids and basesThe process of dissolving an acid or a base in water is a highly exothermic one. Care must be taken while mixing concentrated itric acid or sulphuric acid with water . The acid must always be added slowly to water with constant stirring. If water is added to a concentrated acid, the heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns. The glass container may also break due to excessive local heating. Look out for the warning sign (shown in Fig. 2.5) on the can of concentrated sulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets. Mixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the concentration of ions (H3O+/OH ) per unit volume. Such a process is called dilution and the acid or the base is said to be diluted.

W e have also learnt in the pr evious section about dilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH ions in solutions. Can we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution? Can we judge how strong a given acid or base is? We can do this by making use of a universal indicator , which is a mixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different colours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution. A scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called pH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘ potenz ’ in German, meaning power . On the pH scale we can measur e pH generally fr om 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a umber which indicates the acidic or basic ature of a solution. Higher the hydronium ion concentration, lower is the pH value. The pH of a eutral solution is 7. V alues less than 7 on the pH scale represent an acidic solution. As the pH value increases from 7 to 14, it represents an increase in OH ion concentration in the solution, that is, increase in the strength of alkali (Fig. 2.6). Generally paper impregnated with the universal indicator is used for measuring pH.QUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONS ?1.

It helps in the digestion of food without harming the stomach. During indigestion the stomach produces too much acid and this causes pain and irritation. To get rid of this pain, people use bases called antacids. One such remedy must have been suggested by you at the beginning of this Chapter . These antacids eutralise the excess acid. Magnesium hydroxide (Milk of magnesia), a mild base, is often used for this purpose. pH change as the cause of tooth decaypH change as the cause of tooth decaypH change as the cause of tooth decaypH change as the cause of tooth decaypH change as the cause of tooth decay starts when the pH of the mouth is lower than 5.5. Tooth enamel, made up of calcium hydroxyapatite (a crystalline form of calcium phosphate) is the hardest substance in the body. It does not dissolve in water , but is corr oded when the pH in the mouth is below 5.5. Bacteria present in the mouth produce acids by degradation of sugar and food particles remaining in the mouth after eating. The best way to prevent this is to clean the mouth after eating food. Using toothpastes, which are generally basic, for cleaning the teeth can eutralise the excess acid and prevent tooth decay.

2.4.4 Are the Cr ystals of Salts really Dr y?": "Activity 2.15 Heat a few crystals of copper sulphate in a dry boiling tube. 

- What is the colour of the copper sulphate after heating? 
- Do you notice water droplets in the boiling tube? Where have these come from? 
- Add 23 drops of  water on the sample of copper sulphate obtained after heating. 
- What do you observe? Is the blue colour of copper sulphate restored? Figure 2.9Figure 

2.9 Removing water of crystallisationCopper sulphate crystals which seem to be dry contain water of crystallisation. When we heat the crystals, this water is removed and the salt turns white. If you moisten the crystals again with water , you will find that blue colour of the crystals reappears. Water of crystallisation is the fixed umber of water molecules pr esent in one formula unit of a salt. Five water molecules are present in one formula unit of copper sulphate. Chemical formula for hydrated copper sulphate is Cu SO4. 5H2O. Now you would be able to answer the question whether the molecule of Na2CO3.10H2O is wet. One other salt, which possesses water of crystallisation is gypsum. It has two water molecules as water of cyrstallisation. It has the chemical formula CaSO4.2H2O. Let us look into the use of this salt. Plaster of ParisPlaster of ParisPlaster of Paris On heating gypsum at 373 K, it loses water molecules and becomes calcium sulphate hemihydrate  ( 4 21CaSO .

What y ou hav e learnt Acidbase indicators are dyes or mixtures of dyes which are used to indicate the presence of acids and bases. 

- Acidic ature of a substance is due to the formation of H+(aq) ions in solution. Formation of OH (aq) ions in solution is responsible for the basic ature of a substance. 
- When an acid reacts with a metal, hydrogen gas is evolved and a corresponding salt is formed. 
- When a base reacts with a metal, along with the evolution of hydrogen gas a salt is formed which has a egative ion composed of the metal and oxygen. 
- When an acid reacts with a metal carbonate or metal hydrogencarbonate, it gives the corr esponding salt, carbon dioxide gas and water . 
- Acidic and basic solutions in water conduct electricity because they produce hydrogen and hydroxide ions respectively.  34nThe strength of an acid or an alkali can be tested by using a scale called the pH scale (014) which gives the measure of hydrogen ion concentration in a solution. 
- A eutral solution has a pH of exactly 7, while an acidic solution has a pH less than 7 and a basic solution a pH more than 7.

3 CHAPTER In Class IX you have learnt about various elements. Y ou have seen that elements can be classified as metals or onmetals on the basis of their properties. 

- Think of some uses of metals and onmetals in your daily life. 
- What properties did you think of while categorising elements as metals or onmetals? 
- How are these properties related to the uses of these elements? Let us look at some of these properties in detail.",
        "

3.1.1 Metals": "The easiest way to start grouping substances is by comparing their physical properties. Let us study this with the help of the following activities. For performing A ctivities 3.1 to 3.6, collect the samples of following metals iron, copper , aluminium, magnesium, sodium, lead, zinc and any other metal that is easily available. Activity 3.1 Take samples of  ir on, copper , aluminium and magnesium. Note the appearance of each sample. 

- Clean the surface of each sample by rubbing them with sand paper and note their appearance again. Metals, in their pure state, have a shining surface. This property is called metallic lustre. Activity 3.2 Take small pieces of ir on, copper , aluminium, and magnesium. Try to cut these metals with a sharp knife and note your observations. 
- Hold a piece of sodium metal with a pair of tongs. CAUTION:  Always handle sodium metal with care. Dry it by pressing between the folds of a filter paper . 
- Put it on a watchglass and try to cut it with a knife. 
- What do you observe?  38You will find that some metals can be beaten into thin sheets. This property is called malleability. Did you know that gold and silver are the most malleable metals?Activity 3.3 Take pieces of ir on, zinc, lead and copper . 
- Place any one metal on a block of iron and strike it four or five times with a hammer . What do you observe? 
- Repeat with other metals. 
- Record the change in the shape of these metals.You will find that metals ar e generally har d. The har dness varies from metal to metal. Activity 3.4 List the metals whose wires you have seen in daily life. The ability of metals to be drawn into thin wires is called ductility. Gold is the most ductile metal. Y ou will be surprised to know that a wir e of about 2 km length can be drawn from one gram of gold. It is because of their malleability and ductility that metals can be given different shapes according to our eeds. Can you ame some metals that are used for making cooking vessels? Do you know why these metals are used for making vessels? Let us do the following Activity to find out the answer . Activity 3.5 Take an aluminium or copper wire. Clamp this wire on a stand, as shown in Fig. 3.1. 
- Fix a pin to the free end of the wire using wax. 
- Heat the wire with a spirit lamp, candle or a burner ear the place where it is clamped. 
- What do you observe after some time? 
- Note your observations. Does the metal wire melt? The above activity shows that metals are good conductors of heat and have high melting points. The best conductors of heat are silver and copper . Lead and mer cury ar e comparatively poor conductors of heat. Do metals also conduct electricity? Let us find out.Figure 3.1Figure 

3.1 Metals are good conductors of heat.  Metals and Nonmetals 39You must have seen that the wir es that carry curr ent in your homes have a coating of polyvinylchloride (PVC) or a rubber like material. Why ar e electric wir es coated with such substances? What happens when metals strike a hard surface? Do they produce a sound? The metals that produce a sound on striking a hard surface are said to be sonorous. Can you ow say why school bells are made of metals?",

        "

3.1.2 Nonmetals": "In the previous Class you have learnt that there are very few onmetals as compared to metals. Some of the examples of onmetals are carbon, sulphur , iodine, oxygen, hydr ogen, etc. The onmetals ar e either  solids or gases except bromine which is a liquid. Do onmetals also have physical properties similar to that of metals? Let us find out.Activity 3.6 Set up an electric circuit as shown in Fig. 3.2. 

- Place the metal to be tested in the circuit between terminals A and B as shown. 
- Does the bulb glow? What does this indicate? Figure 3.2Figure 

3.2 Metals are good conductors of electricity. Activity 3.7 Collect samples of carbon (coal or graphite), sulphur and iodine. 

- Carry out the Activities 3.1 to 3.4 and 3.6 with these onmetals and record your observations. Compile your observations regarding metals and onmetals in Table 3.1. Table

Y ou must have concluded that we cannot group elements according to their physical properties alone, as there are many exceptions. For example (i)All metals except mercury exist as solids at room temperature. In Activity 3.5, you have observed that metals have high melting  40points but gallium and caesium have very low melting points. These two metals will melt if you keep them on your palm. (ii)Iodine is a onmetal but it is lustrous. (iii)Carbon is a onmetal that can exist in different forms. Each form is called an allotrope. Diamond, an allotrope of carbon, is the hardest atural substance known and has a very high melting and boiling point. Graphite, another allotrope of carbon, is a conductor of electricity. (iv)Alkali metals (lithium, sodium, potassium) are so soft that they can be cut with a knife. They have low densities and low melting points. Elements can be more clearly classified as metals and onmetals on the basis of their chemical properties. Activity 3.8 Take a magnesium ribbon and some sulphur powder . 

- Burn the magnesium ribbon. Collect the ashes formed and dissolve them in water . 
- Test the resultant solution with both r ed and blue litmus paper . 
- Is the product formed on burning magnesium acidic or basic? 
- Now bur sulphur powder . Place a test tube over the bur ing sulphur to collect the fumes produced. 
- Add some water to the above test tube and shake. 
- Test this solution with blue and red litmus paper . 
- Is the product formed on burning sulphur acidic or basic? 
- Can you write equations for these reactions? QUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONS ?1. Give an example of a metal which (i)is a liquid at room temperature.

3.2 CHEMIC3.2 CHEMICALPROPERTIESOFMETALMETALSALSALS": "We will lear about the chemical pr operties of metals in the following Sections 3.2.1 to 3.2.4. For this, collect the samples of following metals aluminium, copper , iron, lead, magnesium, zinc and sodium. Most onmetals pr oduce acidic oxides when dissolve in water . On the other hand, most metals, give rise to basic oxides. Y ou will be lear ing more about these metal oxides in the ext section.  Metals and Nonmetals 413.2.1 What happens when Metals are bur t in Air? You have seen in Activity 3.8 that magnesium bur s in air with a dazzling white flame. Do all metals react in the same manner? Let us check by performing the following Activity. Activity 3.9 CAUTION : The following activity eeds the teacher’s assistance. It would be better if students wear eye protection. 

- Hold any of the samples taken above with a pair of tongs and try burning over a flame. Repeat with the other metal samples. 
- Collect the product if formed. 
- Let the products and the metal surface cool down. 
- Which metals burn easily? 
- What flame colour did you observe when the metal burnt? 
- How does the metal surface appear after burning? 
- Arrange the metals in the decreasing order of their reactivity towards oxygen. 
- Are the products soluble in water? Almost all metals combine with oxygen to form metal oxides. 
Metal  +  Oxygen Metal
 oxide For example, when copper is heated in air , it combines with oxygen to form copper(II) oxide, a black oxide. 
2Cu  +  O2 2CuO
 (Copper)      (Copper(II) oxide) Similarly, aluminium forms aluminium oxide. 
4Al +3O2 2Al2O3
 (Aluminium) (Aluminium oxide) We have learnt that metal oxides ar e basic in atur e. But some metal oxides, such as aluminium oxide, zinc oxide show both acidic as well as basic behaviour . Such metal oxides which r eact with both acids as well as bases to produce salts and water are known as amphoteric oxides. Aluminium oxide reacts in the following manner with acids and bases 
Al2O3 + 6HCl 2AlCl3+3H2O
 
Al2O3 + 2NaOH 2NaAlO2+H2O
 (Sodium aluminate) Most metal oxides are insoluble in water but some of these dissolve in water to form alkalis. Sodium oxide and potassium oxide dissolve in water to produce alkalis as follows 
Na2O(s) +H2O(l) 2NaOH(aq)
 
K2O(s) +H2O(l) 2KOH(aq)
  42We have observed in Activity 3.9 that all metals do not r eact with oxygen at the same rate. Different metals show different reactivities towards oxygen. Metals such as potassium and sodium react so vigorously that they catch fire if kept in the open. Hence, to protect them and to prevent accidental fires, they are kept immersed in kerosene oil. At ordinary temperature, the surfaces of metals such as magnesium, aluminium, zinc, lead, etc., are covered with a thin layer of oxide. The protective oxide layer prevents the metal from further oxidation. Iron does not burn on heating but iron filings burn vigorously when sprinkled in the flame of the bur er. Copper does not bur 
- , but the hot metal is coated with a black coloured layer of copper(II) oxide. Silver and gold do not react with oxygen even at high temperatures.Do Y ou Know?Anodising is a process of forming a thick oxide layer of aluminium. Aluminium develops a thin oxide layer when exposed to air . This aluminium oxide coat makes it resistant to further corrosion.  The resistance can be improved further by making the oxide layer thicker .  During anodising, a clean aluminium article is made the anode and is electrolysed with dilute sulphuric acid. The oxygen gas evolved at the anode reacts with aluminium to make a thicker pr otective oxide layer .  This oxide layer can be dyed easily to give aluminium articles an attractive finish. After performing Activity 3.9, you must have observed that sodium is the most reactive of the samples of metals taken here. The reaction of magnesium is less vigorous implying that it is not as reactive as sodium. But burning in oxygen does not help us to decide about the reactivity of zinc, iron, copper or lead. Let us see some more reactions to arrive at a conclusion about the order of reactivity of these metals.",

3.2.2 What happens when Metals react with W ater?": "Activity 3.10 CAUTION:  This Activity eeds the teacher’s assistance. 

- Collect the samples of the same metals as in Activity 3.9. 
- Put small pieces of the samples separately in beakers halffilled with cold water . 
- Which metals reacted with cold water? Arrange them in the increasing or der of their r eactivity with cold water . 
- Did any metal produce fire on water? 
- Does any metal start floating after some time? 
- Put the metals that did not react with cold water in beakers halffilled with hot water . 
- For the metals that did not r eact with hot water , arrange the apparatus as shown in Fig.  3.3 and observe their reaction with steam. 
- Which metals did not react even with steam? 
- Arrange the metals in the decr easing or der of r eactivity with water .  Metals and Nonmetals 43Metals react with water and produce a metal oxide and hydrogen gas. Metal oxides that are soluble in water dissolve in it to further form metal hydr oxide. But all metals do not r eact with water .

 hydroxide Metals like potassium and sodium r eact violently with cold water . In case of sodium and potassium, the reaction is so violent and exothermic that the evolved hydrogen immediately catches fire.

 energy 
2Na(s) + 2H2O(l) 2NaOH(aq) + H2(g) + heat
 energy The reaction of calcium with water is less violent. The heat evolved is not sufficient for the hydrogen to catch fire. 
Ca(s) + 2H2O(l) Ca(OH)2(aq) + H2(g)
 Calcium starts floating because the bubbles of hydrogen gas formed stick to the surface of the metal. Magnesium does not react with cold water . It reacts with hot water to form magnesium hydroxide and hydrogen. It also starts floating due to the bubbles of hydrogen gas sticking to its surface. Metals like aluminium, iron and zinc do not react either with cold or hot water . But they r eact with steam to for m the metal oxide and hydr ogen. 
2Al(s) +3H2O(g) Al2O3(s) + 3H2(g)
 
3Fe(s) +4H2O(g) Fe3O4(s) + 4H2(g)
 Metals such as  lead, copper , silver and gold do not r eact with water at all.",

3.2.3 What happens when Metals react with Acids?": "You have alr eady learnt that metals r eact with acids to give a salt and hydrogen gas.Figure 3.3  Action of steam on a metal  44Metal + Dilute acid Salt + Hydrogen But do all metals react in the same manner? Let us find out. Activity 3.11 Collect all the metal samples except sodium and potassium again. If the samples ar e tar ished, rub them clean with sand paper . CAUTION:  Do not take sodium and potassium as they react vigorously even with cold water . 

- Put the samples separately in test tubes containing dilute hydrochloric acid. 
- Suspend thermometers in the test tubes, so that their bulbs are dipped in the acid. 
- Observe the rate of formation of bubbles carefully. 
- Which metals reacted vigorously with dilute hydrochloric acid? 
- With which metal did you record the highest temperature? 
- Arrange the metals in the decreasing order of reactivity with dilute acids. Write equations for the r eactions of magnesium, aluminium, zinc and iron with dilute hydrochloric acid. Hydrogen gas is not evolved when a metal reacts with itric acid. It is because HNO3 is a strong oxidising agent. It oxidises the H2 produced to water and itself gets reduced to any of the itrogen oxides (N2O, NO, NO2). But magnesium (Mg) and manganese (Mn) react with very dilute HNO3 to evolve H2 gas. You must have observed in Activity 3.11, that the rate of for mation of bubbles was the fastest in the case of magnesium. The reaction was also the most exothermic in this case. The reactivity decreases in the order Mg Al > Zn Fe. In the case of copper , 
- o bubbles wer e seen and the temperature also remained unchanged. This shows that copper does not react with dilute HCl.Do Y ou Know?Aqua regia,  (Latin for ‘royal water’) is a freshly prepared mixture of concentrated hydrochloric acid and concentrated itric acid in the ratio of 3:1. It can dissolve gold, even though either of these acids can do so alone. Aqua regia  is a highly corrosive, fuming liquid. It is one of the few reagents that is able to dissolve gold and platinum.",

3.2.4 How do Metals react with Solutions of other Metal": "Salts? Activity 3.12 Take a clean wire of copper and an iron nail. 

- Put the copper wire in a solution of iron sulphate and the iron nail in a solution of copper sulphate taken in test tubes (Fig. 3.4). 
- Record your observations after 20 minutes.  Metals and Nonmetals 45nIn which test tube did you find that a reaction has occurred?

- Can you correlate your observations for the Activities 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11? 
- Write a balanced chemical equation for the r eaction that has taken place. 
- Name the type of reaction. Reactive metals can displace less reactive metals from their compounds in solution or molten form. We have seen in the pr evious sections that all metals ar e not equally r eactive. W e checked the reactivity of various metals with oxygen, water and acids. But all metals do not react with these reagents. So we were not able to put all the metal samples we had collected in decreasing order of their reactivity. Displacement evidence about the reactivity of metals. It is simple and easy if metal A displaces metal B from its solution, it is more reactive than B.

3.3 HOWDOMET3.3 METALSANDNONMETALSNONMETREAREAALSCT? CT?CT?": "In the above activities, you saw the reactions of metals with a umber of reagents. Why do metals react in this manner? Let us recall what we learnt about the electr onic configuration of elements in Class IX. W e learnt that oble gases, which have a completely filled valence shell, show little chemical activity. W e, ther efore, explain the r eactivity of elements as a tendency to attain a completely filled valence shell. Let us have a look at the electronic configuration of oble gases and some metals and onmetals. We can see from T able 3.3 that a sodium atom has one electr on in its outermost shell. If it loses the electron from its M shell then its L shell ow becomes the outermost shell and that has a stable octet. The ucleus of this atom still has 11 protons but the umber of electrons has become 10, so there is a et positive charge giving us a sodium cation Na+. On the other hand chlorine has seven electrons in its outermost shellUse the Table above to answer the following questions about metals A, B, C and D. (i)Which is the most reactive metal? (ii) What would you observe if B is added to a solution of Copper(II) sulphate? (iii) Arrange the metals A, B, C and D in the order of decreasing reactivity. 4.

If sodium and chlorine were to react, the electron lost by sodium could be taken up by chlorine. After gaining an electron, the chlorine atom gets a unit egative charge, because its ucleus has 17 protons and there are 18 electrons in its K, L and M shells.  This gives us a chloride anion C1–. So both these elements can have a giveandtake relation between them as follows (Fig. 3.5). Na + e 2,8,1 2,8+ (Sodium cation )→– Cl +e Cl 2,8,7 2,8,8 (Chloride anion )– –→ Figure 3.5Figure

These compounds are generally brittle and break into pieces when pressure is applied. (ii)Melting and Boiling points : Ionic compounds have high melting and boiling points (see Table 3.4). This is because a considerable amount of ener gy is r equir ed to br eak the str ong inter ionic attraction. (iii)Solubility : Electrovalent compounds are generally soluble in water and insoluble in solvents such as kerosene, petrol, etc. (iv)Conduction of Electricity : The conduction of electricity through a solution involves the movement of charged particles. A solution of an ionic compound in water contains ions, which move to the opposite electrodes when electricity is passed through the solution. Ionic compounds in the solid state do not conduct electricity because movement of ions in the solid is not possible due to their rigid structure. But ionic compounds conduct electricity in the molten state. This is possible in the molten state since the elecrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely charged ions are overcome due to the heat. Thus, the ions move freely and conduct electricity.

Seawater also contains some soluble salts such as sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, etc. The elements or compounds, which occur aturally in the earth’s crust, are known as minerals. At some places, minerals contain a very high percentage of a particular metal and the metal can be profitably extracted from it. These minerals are called ores.",

3.4.1 Extraction of Metals": "You have learnt about the r eactivity series of metals. Having this knowledge, you can easily understand how a metal is extracted from its ore. Some metals are found in the earth’s crust in the free state. Some are found in the form of their compounds. The metals at the bottom of the activity series are the least reactive. They are often found in a free  50state. For example, gold, silver , platinum and copper ar e found in the free state. Copper and silver are also found in the combined state as their sulphide or oxide ores. The metals at the top of the activity series (K, Na, Ca, Mg and Al) are so reactive that they are ever found in ature as free elements. The metals in the middle of the activity series (Zn, Fe, Pb, etc.) are moderately reactive. They are found in the earth’s crust mainly as oxides, sulphides or carbonates. Y ou will find that the or es of many metals ar e oxides. This is because oxygen is a very reactive element and is very abundant on the earth. Thus on th e basis of reactivity, we can group the metals into the following three categories (Fig. 3.9) (i) Metals of low reactivity; (ii) Metals of medium reactivity; (iii) Metals of high reactivity. Different techniques are  to be used for obtaining the metals falling in each category.K Na Ca Mg Al Zn Fe Pb Cu Ag AuReduction using carbon Found in ative stateElectrolysis Figure 3.9 Activity series and related metallurgy Figure 3.10  Steps involved in the extraction of metals from oresSeveral steps are involved in the extraction of pure metal from ores. A summary of these steps is given in Fig.3.10. Each step is explained in detail in the following sections.  Metals and Nonmetals 513.4.2 Enrichment of Ores mined from the earth are usually contaminated with large amounts of impurities such as soil, sand, etc., called gangue. The impurities must be removed from the ore prior to the extraction of the metal. The processes used for removing the gangue from the ore are based on the differences between the physical or chemical properties of the gangue and the ore. Different separation techniques are  accordingly employed.",

3.4.3 Extracting Metals Low in the Activity Series": "Metals low in the activity series are very unreactive. The oxides of these metals can be  reduced to metals by heating alone. For example, cinnabar (HgS) is an or e of mer cury. When it is heated in air , it is first converted into mercuric oxide (HgO). Mercuric oxide is then reduced to mercury on further heating. 2HgS(s) + 3O (g) 2HgO(s) + 2SO (g)2 2Heat  2HgO(s) 2Hg(l) + O (g)2Heat  Similarly, copper which is found as Cu2S in ature can be obtained from its or e by just heating in air . 2Cu S + 3O (g) 2Cu O(s) + 2SO (g) 2Cu O + Cu S 2 2 2 2He at He at     6Cu(s) + SO (g)2",

3.4.4 Extracting Metals in the Middle of Activity Series": "The metals in the middle of the activity series such as iron, zinc, lead, copper , are moderately r eactive. These ar e usually pr esent as sulphides or carbonates in ature. It is easier to obtain a metal from its oxide, as compared to its sulphides and carbonates. Therefore, prior to reduction, the metal sulphides and carbonates must be converted into metal oxides. The sulphide ores are converted into oxides by heating strongly in the pr esence of excess air . This pr ocess is known as r oasting. The carbonate ores are changed into oxides by heating strongly in limited air. This pr ocess is known as calcination. The chemical r eaction that takes place during roasting and calcination of zinc ores can be shown as follows Roasting 2ZnS(s) + 3O (g) 2ZnO(s) + 2SO (g)2 2Heat  Calcination ZnCO (s) ZnO(s) + CO (g)3 2Heat   52The metal oxides are then reduced to the corresponding metals by using suitable reducing agents such as carbon. For example, when zinc oxide is heated with carbon, it is reduced to metallic zinc. 

ZnO(s) + C(s) Zn(s) + CO(g)
 You ar e already familiar with the pr ocess of oxidation and r eduction explained in the first Chapter . Obtaining metals fr om their compounds is also a reduction process. Besides using carbon (coke) to reduce metal oxides to metals, sometimes displacement reactions can also be used. The highly reactive metals such as sodium, calcium, aluminium, etc., are used as reducing agents because they can displace metals of lower reactivity from their compounds. For example, when manganese dioxide is heated with aluminium powder , the following r eaction takes place 
3MnO2(s) + 4Al(s) 3Mn(l) + 2Al2O3(s) + Heat
 Can you identify the substances that are getting oxidised and reduced? These displacement reactions are highly exothermic. The amount of heat evolved is so large that the metals are produced in the molten state. In fact, the reaction of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) with aluminium is used to join railway tracks or cracked machine parts. This reaction is known as the thermit reaction.

3.4.5 Extracting Metals towards the T op of": "Activity Series The metals high up in the reactivity series are very reactive. They cannot be obtained from their compounds by heating with carbon. For example, carbon cannot reduce the oxides of sodium, magnesium, calcium, aluminium, etc., to the respective metals. This is because these metals have more affinity for oxygen than carbon. These metals are obtained by electrolytic reduction. For example, sodium, magnesium and calcium are obtained by the electrolysis of their molten chlorides. The metals are deposited at the cathode (the egatively charged electrode), whereas, chlorine is liberated at the anode (the positively charged electrode). The reactions are At cathode Na+ + e–→Na At anode       2Cl –→

On passing the current through the electrolyte, the pure metal from the anode dissolves into the electrolyte. An equivalent amount of pure metal from the electrolyte is deposited on the cathode.

3.5 CORROSION": "

- Silver articles  become black after some time when exposed to air . This is because it reacts with sulphur in the air to form a coating of silver sulphide. 
- Copper reacts with moist carbon dioxide in the air and slowly loses its shiny brown surface and gains a green coat. This green substance is basic copper carbonate. 
- Iron when exposed to moist air for a long time acquires a coating of a brown flaky substance called rust. Let us find ou t the conditions under which iron rusts.  

543.5.1 Prevention of Corrosion The rusting of iron can be prevented by painting, oiling, greasing, galvanising, chrome plating, anodising or making alloys. Galvanisation is a method of protecting steel and iron from rusting by coating them with a thin layer of zinc. The galvanised article is protected against rusting even if the zinc coating is broken. Can you reason this out? Alloying is a very good method of improving the properties of a metal. We can get the desir ed pr operties by this method. For example, ir on is the most widely used metal. But it is ever used in its pure state. This is because pure iron is very soft and stretches easily when hot. But, if it is mixed with a small amount of carbon (about 0.05 %), it becomes hard and strong. When iron is mixed with ickel and chromium, we get stainless steel, which is hard and does not rust. Thus, if iron is mixed with some other substance, its properties change. In fact, the properties of any metal can be changed if it is mixed with some other substance. The substance added may be a metal or a onmetal. An alloy is a homogeneous mixture of two or more metals, or a metal and a onmetal. It is prepared by first melting the primary metal, and then, dissolving the other elements in it in definite proportions. It is then cooled to room temperature.Activity 3.14 Take three test tubes and place clean iron ails in each of them. 

- Label these test tubes A, B and C. Pour some water in test tube A and cork it. 
- Pour boiled distilled water in test tube B, add about 1 mL of oil and cork it. The oil will float on water and prevent the air from dissolving in the water . 
- Put some anhydrous calcium chloride in test tube C and cork it. Anhydrous calcium chloride will absorb the moisture, if any, from the air . Leave these test tubes for a few days and then observe (Fig. 3.13). You will observe that ir on ails rust in test tube A, but they do not rust in test tubes B and C. In the test tube A, the ails ar e exposed to both air and water . In the test tube B, the ails ar e exposed to only water , and the ails in test tube C ar e exposed to dry air .

It means that 22 parts of pure gold is alloyed with 2 parts of either copper or silver . If one of the metals is mercury, then the alloy is known as an amalgam. The electrical conductivity and melting point of an alloy is less than that of pure metals. For example, brass, an alloy of copper and zinc (Cu and Zn), and bronze, an alloy of copper and tin (Cu and Sn), are not good conductors of electricity whereas copper is used for making electrical cir cuits. Solder , an alloy of lead and tin (Pb and Sn), has a low melting point and is used for welding electrical wir es together.

6 CHAPTER How do we tell the difference between what is alive and what is not alive? If we see a dog running, or a cow chewing cud, or a man shouting loudly on the street, we know that these are living beings. What if the dog or the cow or the man wer e asleep? W e would still think that they wer e alive, but how did we know that? W e see them br eathing, and we know that they are alive. What about plants? How do we know that they ar e alive? W e see them gr een, some of us will say. But what about plants that have leaves of colours other than green? They grow over time, so we know that they are alive, some will say. In other words, we tend to think of some sort of movement, either growthrelated or not, as common evidence for being alive. But a plant that is not visibly growing is still alive, and some animals can breathe without visible movement. So using visible movement as the defining characteristic of life is not enough. Movements over very small scales will be invisible to the aked eye movements of molecules, for example. Is this invisible molecular movement ecessary for life? If we ask this question to professional biologists, they will say yes. In fact, viruses do not show any molecular movement in them (until they infect some cell), and that is partly why there is a controversy about whether they are truly alive or not. Why ar e molecular movements eeded for life? W e have seen in earlier classes that living organisms are wellorganised structures; they can have tissues, tissues have cells, cells have smaller components in them, and so on. Because of the effects of the environment, this organised, ordered ature of living structures is very likely to keep breaking down over time. If order breaks down, the organism will o longer be alive. So living creatures must keep repairing and maintaining their structures. Since all these structures are made up of molecules, they must move molecules around all the time. What are the maintenance processes in living organisms? Let us explore.",

        "

6.1 WHA6.1 WHATARELIFEPROCESSES?T PROCESSES?": "The maintenance functions of living organisms must go on even when they ar e not doing anything particular . Even when we ar e just sitting in  60class, even if we are just asleep, this maintenance job has to go on. The processes which together perform this maintenance job are life processes. Since these maintenance processes are eeded to prevent damage and breakdown, energy is eeded for them. This energy comes from outside the body of the individual organism. So there must be a process to transfer a source of energy from outside the body of the organism, which we call food, to the inside, a process we commonly call utrition. If the body size of the organisms is to grow, additional raw material will also be eeded from outside. Since life on earth depends on carbonbased molecules, most of these food sources are also carbonbased. Depending on the complexity of these carbon sources, different organisms can then use different kinds of utritional processes. The outside sources of energy could be quite varied, since the environment is not under the control of the individual organism. These sources of energy, therefore, 

- eed to be broken down or built up in the body, and must be finally converted to a uniform source of energy that can be used for the various molecular movements eeded for maintaining living str uctures, as well as to the kind of molecules the body eeds to grow. For this, a series of chemical reactions in the body are ecessary. Oxidisingreducing reactions are some of the most common chemical means to break down molecules. For this, many organisms use oxygen sourced from outside the body. The process of acquiring oxygen from outside the body, and to use it  in the process of break down of food sources for cellular eeds, is what we call respiration. In the case of a singlecelled organism, 
- o specific organs for taking in food, exchange of gases or removal of wastes may be eeded because the entire surface of the organism is in contact with the environment. But what happens when the body size of the organism increases and the body design becomes more complex? In multicellular organisms, all the cells may not be in direct contact with the surrounding environment. Thus, simple diffusion will not meet the requirements of all the cells. We have seen pr eviously how, in multicellular organisms, various body parts have specialised in the functions they per form. We are familiar with the idea of these specialised tissues, and with their organisation in the body of the organism. It is therefore not surprising that the uptake of food and of oxygen will also be the function of specialised tissues. However , this poses a pr oblem, since the food and oxygen ar e ow taken up at one place in the body of the organisms, while all parts of the body eed them. This situation creates a eed for a transportation system for carrying food and oxygen from one place to another in the body. When chemical reactions use the carbon source and the oxygen for energy generation,  they create byproducts that are not only useless for the cells of the body, but could even be harmful. These waste byproducts are  therefore eeded to be removed from the body and discarded outside  by a process called excretion. Again, if the basic rules for body  Life Processes 61design in multicellular organisms are followed, a specialised tissue for excretion will be developed, which means that the transportation system will eed to transport waste away from cells to this excretory tissue. Let us consider these various processes, so essential to maintain life, one by one. QUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONS ?1. Why is diffusion insufficient to meet the oxygen requirements of multicellular organisms like humans? 2. What criteria do we use to decide whether something is alive? 3. What are outside raw materials used for by an organism? 4. What processes would you consider essential for maintaining life?",

6.2 NUTRITION": "When we walk or ride a bicycle, we are using up energy. Even when we are not doing any apparent activity, energy is eeded to maintain a state of or der in our body. W e also eed materials fr om outside in or der to grow, develop, synthesise protein and other substances eeded in the body. This source of energy and materials is the food we eat. How do living things get their food?How do living things get their food?How do living things get their food?How do living things get their food?How do living things get their food? The general requirement for energy and materials is common in all organisms, but it is fulfilled in different ways. Some organisms use simple food material obtained from inorganic sources in the form of carbon dioxide and water . These or ganisms, the autotr ophs, include gr een plants and some bacteria. Other organisms utilise complex substances. These complex substances have to be broken down into simpler ones before they can be used for the upkeep and growth of the body. To achieve this, organisms use biocatalysts called enzymes. Thus, the heterotrophs survival depends directly or indirectly on autotrophs. Heterotrophic organisms include animals and fungi.",

        "

6.2.1 Autotrophic Nutrition": "Carbon and energy requirements of the autotrophic organism are fulfilled by photosynthesis. It is the process by which autotrophs take in substances from the outside and convert them into stored forms of energy. This material is taken in the form of carbon dioxide and water which is converted into carbohydrates in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll. Carbohydrates are utilised for providing energy to the plant. We will study how this takes place in the ext section. The carbohydrates which are not used immediately are stored in the form of starch, which serves as the internal energy reserve to be used as and when required by the plant. A somewhat similar situation is seen in us where some of the energy derived from the food we eat is stored in our body in the form of glycogen.  62Let us ow see what actually happens during the process of photosynthesis. The following events occur during this process Figure 6.2 Variegated leaf (a) befor e and (b) after starch testFigure 6.1 Crosssection of a leaf Activity 6.1 Take a potted plant with variegated leaves for example, money plant or crotons. 

- Keep the plant in a dark room for three days so that all the starch gets used up. 
- Now keep the plant in sunlight for about six hours. 
- Pluck a leaf from the plant. Mark the green areas in it and trace them on a sheet of paper . 
- Dip the leaf in boiling water for a few minutes. 
- After this, immerse it in a beaker containing alcohol. 
- Carefully place the above beaker in a water bath and heat till the alcohol begins to boil. 
- What happens to the colour of the leaf? What is the colour of the solution? 
- Now dip the leaf in a dilute solution of iodine for a few minutes. 
- Take out the leaf and rinse off the iodine solution. 
- Observe the colour of the leaf and compare this with the tracing of the leaf done in the beginning (Fig. 6.2). 
- What can you conclude about the presence of starch in various areas of the leaf?(i)Absorption of light energy by chlorophyll. (ii)Conversion of light energy to chemical energy and splitting of water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. (iii)Reduction of carbon dioxide to carbohydrates. These steps eed 
- ot take place one after the other immediately. For example, desert plants take up carbon dioxide at ight and prepare an intermediate which is acted upon by the energy absorbed by the chlorophyll during the day. Let us see how each of the components of the above reaction are ecessary for photosynthesis. If you carefully observe a crosssection of a leaf under the microscope (shown in Fig. 6.1), you will notice that some cells contain green dots. These green dots are cell organelles called chloroplasts which contain chlorophyll. Let us do an activity which demonstrates that chlorophyll is essential for photosynthesis.  Life Processes 63Now, let us study how the plant obtains carbon dioxide. In Class IX, we had talked about stomata (Fig. 6.3) which are tiny pores present on the surface of the leaves. Massive amounts of gaseous exchange takes place in the leaves through these pores for the purpose of photosynthesis. But it is important to note here that exchange of gases occurs across the surface of stems, roots and leaves as well. Since large amounts of water can also be lost through these stomata, the plant closes these pores when it does not 
- eed carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. The opening and closing of the pore is a function of the guard cells. The guard cells swell when water flows into them, causing the stomatal pore to open. Similarly the pore closes if the guard cells shrink. 
- Take two healthy potted plants which are early the same size. 
- Keep them in a dark room for three days. 
- Now place each plant on separate glass plates. Place a watchglass containing potassium hydroxide by the side of one of the plants. The potassium hydroxide is used to absorb carbon dioxide. 
- Cover both plants with separate belljars as shown in Fig. 6.4. 
- Use vaseline to seal the bottom of the jars to the glass plates so that the setup is air tight. 
- Keep the plants in sunlight for about two hours.

6.2.2 Heterotrophic Nutrition": "Each organism is adapted to its environment. The form of utrition differs depending on the type and availability of food material as well as how it is obtained by the organism. For example, whether the food source is stationary (such as grass) or mobile (such as a deer), would allow for differences in how the food is accessed and what is the utritive apparatus used by a cow and a lion. There is a range of strategies by which the food is taken in and used by the organism. Some organisms breakdown the food material outside the body and then absorb it. Examples are fungi like bread moulds, yeast and mushrooms. Others take in whole material and break it down inside their bodies. What can be taken in and broken down depends on the body design and functioning. Some other organisms derive utrition from plants or animals without killing them. This parasitic utritive strategy is used by a wide variety of or ganisms like cuscuta (amar bel),  ticks, lice, leeches and tapeworms.",

6.2.3 How do Organisms obtain their Nutrition?": "Since the food and the way it is obtained dif fer, the digestive system is different in various organisms. In singlecelled organisms, the food may be taken in by the entire surface. But as the complexity of the organism increases, different parts become specialised to perform different functions. For example, Amoeba takes in food using temporary finger like extensions of the cell sur face which fuse over the food particle forming a foodvacuole (Fig. 6.5). Inside the foodvacuole, complex substances are broken down into simpler ones which then diffuse into the cytoplasm. The remaining undigested material is moved to the surface of the cell and thrown out. In Paramoecium , which is also a unicellular organism, the cell has a definite shape and food is taken in at a specific spot. Food is moved to this spot by the movement of cilia which cover the entire surface of the cell.",

6.2.4 Nutrition in Human Beings": "The alimentary canal is basically a long tube extending from the mouth to the anus. In Fig. 6.6, we can see that the tube has different parts. Various r egions ar e specialised to per form dif ferent functions. What happens to the food once it enters our body? W e shall discuss this process here.Figure 6.5 Nutrition in Amoeba  Life Processes 65Activity 6.3 Take 1 mL starch solution (1%) in two test tubes (A and B). 

- Add 1 mL saliva to test tube A and leave both test tubes undisturbed for 2030 minutes. 
- Now add a few drops of dilute iodine solution to the test tubes. 
- In which test tube do you observe a colour change? 
- What does this indicate about the presence or absence of starch in the two test tubes? 
- What does this tell us about the action of saliva on starch? We eat various types of food which has to pass thr ough the same digestive tract. Naturally the food has to be processed to generate particles which are small and of the same texture. This is achieved by crushing the food with our teeth. Since the lining of the canal is soft, the food is also wetted to make its passage smooth. When we eat something we like, our mouth ‘waters’. This is actually not only water , but a fluid called saliva secreted by the salivary glands. Another aspect of the food we ingest is its complex ature. If it is to be absorbed from the alimentary canal, it has to be broken into smaller molecules. This is done with the help of biological catalysts called enzymes. The saliva contains an enzyme called salivary amylase that breaks down starch which is a complex molecule to give simple sugar . The food is mixed thoroughly with saliva and moved around the mouth while chewing by the muscular tongue. It is ecessary to move the food in a regulated manner along the digestive tube so that it can be processed properly in each part. The lining of canal has muscles that contract rhythmically in order to push the food forward. These peristaltic movements occur all along the gut. From the mouth, the food is taken to the stomach through the foodpipe or oesophagus. The stomach is a large organ which expands when food enters it. The muscular walls of the stomach help in mixing the food thoroughly with more digestive juices. The digestion in stomach is taken care of by the gastric glands present in the wall of the stomach. These release hydrochloric acid, a protein digesting enzyme called pepsin, and mucus. The hydrochloric acid creates an acidic medium which facilitates the action of the enzyme pepsin. What other function do you think is served by the acid? The mucus protects the inner lining of the stomach fr om the action of the acid under or mal conditions. W e Figure 6.6Figure 

6.6  Human alimentary canal  66have often heard adults complaining about ‘acidity’. Can this be related to what has been discussed above? The exit of food from the stomach is regulated by a sphincter muscle which releases it in small amounts into the small intestine. From the stomach, the food ow enters the small intestine. This is the longest part of the alimentary canal which is fitted into a compact space because of extensive coiling. The length of the small intestine differs in various animals depending on the food they eat. Herbivores eating grass eed a longer small intestine to allow the cellulose to be digested. Meat is easier to digest, hence carnivores like tigers have a shorter small intestine. The small intestine is the site of the complete digestion of carbohydrates, proteins and fats. It receives the secretions of the liver and pancreas for this purpose. The food coming from the stomach is acidic and has to be made alkaline for the pancreatic enzymes to act. Bile juice from the liver accomplishes this in addition to acting on fats. Fats are present in the intestine in the form of large globules which makes it difficult for enzymes to act on them. Bile salts break them down into smaller globules increasing the efficiency of enzyme action. This is similar to the emulsifying action of soaps on dirt that we have learnt about in"

Digested food is taken up by the walls of the intestine. The inner lining of the small intestine has umer ous finger like pr ojections called villi which increase the surface area for absorption. The villi are richly supplied with blood vessels which take the absorbed food to each and every cell of the body, where it is utilised for obtaining energy, building up ew tissues and the repair of old tissues. The unabsorbed food is sent into the large intestine where its wall absorb more water from this material. The rest of the material is removed from the body via the anus.

It begins when bacteria acting on sugars produce acids that softens or demineralises the enamel. Masses of bacterial cells together with food particles stick to the teeth to form dental plaque. Saliva cannot reach the tooth surface to eutralise the acid as plaque covers the teeth. Brushing the teeth after eating removes the plaque before the bacteria produce acids. If untreated, microorganisms may invade the pulp, causing inflammation and infection.  Life Processes

- What does this tell us about the products of fermentation? We have discussed utrition in organisms in the last section. The food material taken in during the process of utrition is used in cells to provide energy for various life processes. Diverse organisms do this in different ways some use oxygen to breakdown glucose completely into carbon dioxide and water , some use other pathways that do not involve oxygen (Fig. 6.8). In all cases, the first step is the breakdown of glucose, a sixcarbon molecule, into a threecarbon molecule called pyruvate. This pr ocess takes place in the cytoplasm. Further , the pyruvate may be converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide. This process takes place in yeast during fermentation. Since this process takes place in the absence of air (oxygen), it is called anaerobic respiration. Breakdown of pyruvate using oxygen takes place in the mitochondria. ThisFigure 6.7 (a) Air being passed into lime water with a pichkari/ syringe,  (b) air being exhaled into lime water  68process breaks up the threecarbon pyruvate molecule to give three molecules of carbon dioxide. The other pr oduct is water . Since this process takes place in the presence of air (oxygen), it is called aerobic respiration. The release of energy in this aerobic process is a lot greater than in the anaerobic process. Sometimes, when there is a lack of oxygen in our muscle cells, another pathway for the breakdown of pyruvate is taken. Here the pyruvate is converted into lactic acid which is also a threecarbon molecule. This buildup of lactic acid in our muscles during sudden activity causes cramps. Figure 6.8Figure 

6.8  Breakdown of glucose by various pathways The energy released during cellular respiration is immediately used to synthesise a molecule called ATP which is used to fuel all other activities in the cell. In these processes, ATP is broken down giving rise to a fixed amount of energy which can drive the endothermic reactions taking place in the cell. A AA AATP TPTP ATP is the energy currency for most cellular processes. The energy released during the process of respiration is used to make an ATP molecule from ADP and inorganic phosphate. Endothermic processes in the cell then use this ATP to drive the reactions. When the terminal phosphate linkage in A TP is br oken using water , the ener gy equivalent to",

Since the aerobic respiration pathway depends on oxygen, aerobic organisms eed to ensur e that ther e is suf ficient intake of oxygen. W e have seen that plants exchange gases through stomata, and the large intercellular spaces ensur e that all cells ar e in contact with air . Carbon dioxide and oxygen are exchanged by diffusion here. They can go intoMore to Know!  Life Processes 69cells, or away fr om them and out into the air . The dir ection of dif fusion depends upon the environmental conditions and the requirements of the plant. At ight, when there is o photosynthesis occurring, CO2 elimination is the major exchange activity going on. During the day, CO2 generated during respiration is used up for photosynthesis, hence there is o CO2 release. Instead, oxygen release is the major event at this time. Animals have evolved different organs for the uptake of oxygen from the environment and for getting rid of the carbon dioxide produced. Terrestrial animals can breathe the oxygen in the atmosphere, but animals that live in water eed to use the oxygen dissolved in water . Activity 6.6 Observe fish in an aquarium. They open and close their mouths and the gillslits (or the operculum which covers the gillslits) behind their eyes also open and close. Are the timings of the opening and closing of the mouth and gillslits coordinated in some manner? 
- Count the umber of times the fish opens and closes its mouth in a minute. 
- Compare this to the umber of times you breathe in and out in a minute. Since the amount of dissolved oxygen is fairly low compared to the amount of oxygen in the air , the rate of br eathing in aquatic or ganisms is much faster than that seen in terrestrial organisms. Fishes take in water through their mouths and force it past the gills where the dissolved oxygen is taken up by blood. Terrestrial organisms use the oxygen in the atmosphere for respiration. This oxygen is absorbed by different organs in different animals. All these organs have a structure that increases the surface area which is in contact with the oxygenrich atmosphere. Since the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide has to take place across this surface, this surface is very fine and delicate. In order to protect this surface, it is usually placed within the body, so there have to be passages that will take air to this area. In addition, there is a mechanism for moving the air in and out of this area where the oxygen is absorbed. In human beings (Fig. 6.9), air is taken into the body through the ostrils. The air passing through the ostrils is filtered by fine hairs that line the passage. The passage is also lined with mucus which helps in this process. From here, the air passes through the throat and into the lungs. Rings of cartilage are present in the throat. These ensure that the airpassage does not collapse.  70Within the lungs, the passage divides into smaller and smaller tubes which finally terminate in balloonlike structures which are called alveoli (singular alveolus) . The alveoli provide a surface where the exchange of gases can take place. The walls of the alveoli contain an extensive etwork of bloodvessels. As we have seen in earlier years, when we breathe in, we lift our ribs and flatten our diaphragm, and the chest cavity becomes larger as a result. Because of this, air is sucked into the lungs and fills the expanded alveoli. The blood brings carbon dioxide from the rest of the body for release into the alveoli, and the oxygen in the alveolar air is taken up by blood in the alveolar blood vessels to be transported to all the cells in the body. During the breathing cycle, when air is taken in and let out, the lungs always contain a residual volume of air so that there is sufficient time for oxygen to be absorbed and for the carbon dioxide to be released. When the body size of animals is large,  the diffusion pressure alone cannot take care of oxygen delivery to all parts of the body. Instead, respiratory pigments take up oxygen from the air in the lungs and carry it to tissues which are deficient in oxygen before releasing it. In human beings, the respiratory pigment is haemoglobin which has a very high affinity for oxygen. This pigment is present in the red blood corpuscles. Carbon dioxide is more soluble in water than oxygen is and hence is mostly transported in the dissolved form in our blood. Figure 6.9Figure

- How would the difference, if any, be explained? We have seen in pr evious sections that blood transports food, oxygen and waste materials in our bodies. In Class IX, we learnt about blood being a fluid connective tissue. Blood consists of a fluid medium called plasma in which the cells are suspended. Plasma transports food, carbon dioxide and itrogenous wastes in dissolved form. Oxygen is carried by the red blood corpuscles. Many other substances like salts, are also transported by the blood. W e thus eed a pumping or gan to push blood around the body, a etwork of tubes to reach all the tissues and a system in place to ensure that this etwork can be repaired if damaged.  72The heart is a muscular organ which is as big as our fist (Fig. 6.10). Because both oxygen and carbon dioxide have to be transported by the blood, the heart has different chambers to prevent the oxygenrich blood from mixing with the blood containing carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxiderich blood has to reach the lungs for the carbon dioxide to be removed, and the oxygenated blood from the lungs has to be brought back to the heart. This oxygenrich blood is then pumped to the rest of the body. We can follow this pr ocess step by step (Fig. 6.11). Oxygenrich blood from the lungs comes to the thinwalled upper chamber of the heart on the left, the left atrium. The left atrium relaxes when it is collecting this blood. It then contracts, while the ext chamber , the left ventricle, relaxes, so that the blood is transferred to it. When the muscular left ventricle contracts in its turn, the blood is pumped out to the body. Deoxygenated blood comes from the body to the upper chamber on the right, the right atrium, as it relaxes. As the right atrium contracts, the corr esponding lower chamber , the right ventricle, dilates. This transfers blood to the right ventricle, which in turn pumps it to the lungs for oxygenation. Since ventricles have to pump blood into various organs, they have thicker muscular walls than the atria do. V alves ensur e that blood does not flow backwards when the atria or ventricles contract. Oxygen enters the blood in the lungsOxygen enters the blood in the lungsOxygen enters the blood in the lungsOxygen enters the blood in the lungsOxygen enters the blood in the lungs The separation of the right side and the left side of the heart is useful to keep oxygenated and deoxygenated blood from mixing. Such separation allows a highly efficient supply of oxygen to the body. This is useful in animals that have high energy eeds, such as birds and mammals, which constantly use energy to maintain their body temperature. In animals that do not use energy for this purpose, the body temperature depends on the temperature in the environment. Such animals, like amphibians or  many reptiles have threechambered hearts, and tolerate some mixing of the oxygenated and deoxygenated blood streams. Fishes, on the other hand, have only two chambers to their hearts, and the blood is pumped to the gills, is oxygenated there, and passes directly to the rest of the body. Thus, blood goes only once through the heart in the fish during one cycle of passage through the body. On the other hand, it goes through the heart twice during each cycle in other vertebrates. This is known as double circulation.Our pump — the heartOur pump — the heartOur pump — the heartOur pump — the heartOur pump — the heart Figure 6.10Figure

Blood pressur e is measur ed with an instrument called sphygmomanometer . High blood pressure is also called hypertension and is caused by the constriction of arterioles, which results in increased resistance to blood flow. It can lead to the rupture of an artery and internal bleeding.Blood pressureBlood pressureBlood pressure The force that blood exerts against the wall of a vessel is called blood pressure. This pressure is much greater in arteries than in veins. The pressure of blood inside the artery during ventricular systole (contraction) is called systolic pressure and pressure in artery during ventricular diastole (relaxation) is called diastolic pressure. The ormal systolic pressure is about 120 mm of Hg and diastolic pressure is 80 mm of Hg. The tubes blood vesselsThe tubes blood vesselsThe tubes blood vesselsThe tubes blood vesselsThe tubes blood vessels Arteries are the vessels which carry blood away from the heart to various organs of the body. Since the blood emerges from the heart under high pressur e, the arteries have thick, elastic walls. V eins collect the blood from different organs and bring it back to the heart. They do not 

- eed thick walls because the blood is o longer under pressure, instead they have valves that ensure that the blood flows only in one direction. On reaching an organ or tissue, the artery divides into smaller and smaller vessels to bring the blood in contact with all the individual cells. The smallest vessels have walls which are onecell thick and are called capillaries. Exchange of material between the blood and surrounding cells takes place across this thin wall. The capillaries then join together to form veins that convey the blood away from the organ or tissue. Maintenance by plateletsMaintenance by plateletsMaintenance by platelets What happens if this system of tubes develops a leak? Think about situations when we are injured and start bleeding. Naturally the loss of blood from the system has to be minimised. In addition, leakage would lead to a loss of pressure which would reduce the efficiency of the  74pumping system. To avoid this, the blood has platelet cells which circulate around the body and plug these leaks by helping to clot the blood at these points of injury. Lymph LymphLymph There is another type of fluid also involved in transportation. This is called lymph or tissue fluid. Through the pores present in the walls of capillaries some amount of plasma, proteins and blood cells escape into intercellular spaces in the tissues to form the tissue fluid or lymph. It is similar to the plasma of blood but colourless and contains less protein. Lymph drains into lymphatic capillaries fr om the inter cellular spaces, which join to form large lymph vessels that finally open into larger veins. Lymph carries digested and absorbed fat from intestine and drains excess fluid from extra cellular space back into the blood.",

6.4.2 T ranspor tation in Plants": "We have discussed earlier how plants take in simple compounds such as CO2 and photosynthesise energy stored in their chlorophyllcontaining organs, 

- amely leaves. The other kinds of raw materials eeded for building plant bodies will also have to be taken up separately. For plants, the soil is the earest and richest source of raw materials like itrogen, phosphorus and other minerals. The absorption of these substances therefore occurs through the part in contact with the soil, 
- amely roots. If the distances between soilcontacting organs and chlorophyllcontaining organs are small, energy and raw materials can easily diffuse to all parts of the plant body. But if these distances become large because of changes in plant body design, diffusion processes will not be sufficient to provide raw material in leaves and energy in roots. A proper system of transportation is therefore essential in such situations. Energy eeds differ between different body designs. Plants do not move, and plant bodies have a large proportion of dead cells in many tissues. As a result, plants have low energy eeds, and can use relatively slow transport systems. The distances over which transport systems have to operate, however , can be very large in plants such as very tall trees. Plant transport systems will move energy stores from leaves and raw materials from roots. These two pathways are constructed as independently organised conducting tubes. One, the xylem  moves water and minerals obtained fr om the soil. The other , phloem transports products of photosynthesis from the leaves where they are synthesised to other parts of the plant. W e have studied the structur e of these tissues in detail in Class IX. Transport of waterTransport of waterTransport of water In xylem tissue, vessels and tracheids of the roots, stems and leaves are interconnected to for m a continuous system of water conducting channels reaching all parts of the plant. At the roots, cells in contact with the soil actively take up ions. This creates a difference in the concentration of these ions between the r oot and the soil. W ater, ther efore,  Life Processes 75moves into the root from the soil to eliminate this difference. This means that there is steady movement of water into root xylem, creating a column of water that is steadily pushed upwards. However , this pr essur e by itself is unlikely to be enough to move water over the heights that we commonly see in plants. Plants use another strategy to move water in the xylem upwards to the highest points of the plant body. Activity 6.8 Take two small pots of approximately the same size and having the same amount of soil. One should have a plant in it. Place a stick of the same height as the plant in the other pot. 
- Cover the soil in both pots with a plastic sheet so that moisture cannot escape by evaporation. 
- Cover both sets, one with the plant and the other with the stick, with plastic sheets and place in bright sunlight for half an hour . 
- Do you observe any difference in the two cases? Provided that the plant has an adequate supply of water , the water which is lost thr ough the stomata is replaced by water from the xylem vessels in the leaf. In fact, evaporation of water molecules from the cells of a leaf creates a suction which pulls water from the xylem cells of roots. The loss of water in the form of vapour from the aerial parts of the plant is known as transpiration. Thus, transpiration helps in the absorption and upward movement of water and minerals dissolved in it from roots to the leaves. It also helps in temperature regulation. The effect of root pressure in transport of water is more important at ight. During the day when the stomata are open, the transpiration pull becomes the major driving force in the movement of water in the xylem. Transport of food and other substancesTransport of food and other substances So far we have discussed the transport of water and minerals in plants. Now let us consider how the products of metabolic processes, particularly photosynthesis, are moved from leaves, where they are formed, to other parts of the plant. This transport of soluble products of photosynthesis is called translocation and it occurs in the part of the vascular tissue known as phloem. Besides the products of photosynthesis, the phloem transports amino acids and other substances. These substances are especially delivered to the storage organs of roots, fruits and seeds and to growing organs. The translocation of food and other substances takes place in the sieve tubes with the help of adjacent companion cells both in upward and downward directions. Unlike transport in xylem which can be largely explained by simple physical forces, the translocation in phloem is achieved by utilising Figure 6.12Figure 

6.12 Movement of water during transpiration in a tree  76energy. Material like sucrose is transferred into phloem tissue using energy from A TP. This incr eases the osmotic pressur e of the tissue causing water to move into it. This pressure moves the material in the phloem to tissues which have less pressure. This allows the phloem to move material according to the plant’s eeds. For example, in the spring, sugar stored in root or stem tissue would be transported to the buds which eed energy to grow.

6.5.1 Excretion in Human Beings": "The excretory system of human beings (Fig. 6.13) includes a pair of kidneys, a pair of ureters, a urinary bladder and a urethra. Kidneys are located in the abdomen, one on either side of the backbone. Urine produced in the kidneys passes through the ureters into the urinary bladder where it is stored until it is released through the urethra. How is urine produced? The purpose of making urine is to filter out waste products from the blood. Just as CO2 is removed from the blood in the lungs, 

- itrogenous waste such as urea or uric acid are removed from blood in the kidneys. It is then o surprise that the basic filtration unit in the kidneys, Figure 6.13Figure 

6.13 Excretory system in human beings  Life Processes 77like in the lungs, is a cluster of very thinwalled blood capillaries. Each capillary cluster in the kidney is associated with the cupshaped end of a coiled tube called Bowman’s capsule that collects the filtrate (Fig. 6.14). Each kidney has large umbers of these filtration units called ephr ons packed close together . Some substances in the initial filtrate, such as glucose, amino acids, salts and a major amount of water , are selectively reabsorbed as the urine flows along the tube. The amount of water reabsorbed depends on how much excess water there is in the body, and on how much of dissolved waste there is to be excreted. The urine forming in each kidney eventually enters a long tube, the ur eter, which connects the kidneys with the urinary bladder . Urine is stored in the urinary bladder until the pressure of the expanded bladder leads to the urge to pass it out through the ur ethra. The bladder is muscular , so it is under ervous control, as we have discussed elsewhere. As a result, we can usually control the urge to urinate. More to Know!Artificial kidney (Hemodialysis)Artificial kidney (Hemodialysis)Artificial kidney (Hemodialysis)Artificial kidney (Hemodialysis)Artificial kidney (Hemodialysis) Kidneys are vital organs for survival. Several factors like infections, injury or restricted blood flow to kidneys reduce the activity of kidneys. This leads to accumulation of poisonous wastes in the body, which can even lead to death. In case of kidney failure, an artificial kidney can be used. An artificial kidney is a device to remove itrogenous waste products from the blood through dialysis. Artificial kidneys contain a umber of tubes with a semipermeable lining, suspended in a tank filled with dialysing fluid. This fluid has the same osmotic pressure as blood, except that it is devoid of itrogenous wastes. The patient’s blood is passed through these tubes. During this passage, the waste products from the blood pass into dialysing fluid by diffusion. The purified blood is pumped back into the patient. This is similar to the function of the kidney, but it is different since there is o reabsorption involved. Normally, in a healthy adult, the initial filtrate in the kidneys is about 180 L daily. However , the volume actually excreted is only a litre or two a day, because the remaining filtrate is reabsorbed in the kidney tubules.

Oxygen itself can be thought of as a waste product generated during photosynthesis! W e have discussed earlier how plants deal with oxygen as well as CO2.

Many plant waste pr oducts ar e stor ed in cellular vacuoles. W aste pr oducts may be stored in leaves that fall off. Other waste products are stored as resins and gums, especially in old xylem.

What y ou hav e learnt Movement of various types can be taken as an indication of life. 

- Maintenance of life requires processes like utrition, respiration, transport of materials within the body and excretion of waste products. 
- Autotrophic utrition involves the intake of simple inorganic materials from the environment and using an external energy source like the Sun to synthesise complex highenergy organic material. 
- Heterotrophic utrition involves the intake of complex material prepared by other organisms. 
- In human beings, the food eaten is broken down by various steps along the alimentary canal and the digested food is absorbed in the small intestine to be sent to all cells in the body. 
- During the process of respiration, organic compounds such as glucose are broken down to pr ovide ener gy in the for m of A TP. ATP is used to provide ener gy for other reactions in the cell. 
- Respiration may be aerobic or anaerobic. Aerobic respiration makes more energy available to the organism. 
- In human beings, the transport of materials such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, food and excretory products is a function of the circulatory system. The circulatory system consists of the heart, blood and blood vessels. 
- In highly dif ferentiated plants, transport of water , minerals, food and other materials is a function of the vascular tissue which consists of xylem and phloem.  Life Processes 79nIn human beings, excretory products in the form of soluble itrogen compounds are removed by the ephrons in the kidneys. 
- Plants use a variety of techniques to get rid of waste material.

7 CHAPTER In the pr evious chapter , we looked at life pr ocesses involved in the maintenance functions in living organisms. There, we had started with a notion we all have, that if we see something moving, it is alive. Some of these movements are in fact the result of growth, as in plants. A seed germinates and grows, and we can see that the seedling moves over the course of a few days, it pushes soil aside and comes out. But if its growth were to be stopped, these movements would not happen. Some movements, as in many animals and some plants, are not connected with growth. A cat running, children playing on swings, buffaloes chewing cud these are not movements caused by growth. Why do we associate such visible movements with life? A possible answer is that we think of movement as a response to a change in the environment of the organism. The cat may be running because it has seen a mouse.  Not only that, we also think of movement as an attempt by living organisms to use changes in their environment to their advantage. Plants grow out into the sunshine. Children try to get pleasure and fun out of swinging. Buffaloes chew cud to help break up tough food so as to be able to digest it better . When bright light is focussed on our eyes or when we touch a hot object, we detect the change and respond to it with movement in order to protect ourselves. If we think a bit more about this, it becomes apparent that all this movement, in response to the environment, is carefully controlled. Each kind of a change in the environment evokes an appropriate movement in response. When we want to talk to our friends in class, we whisper , rather than shouting loudly. Clearly, the movement to be made depends on the event that is triggering it. Therefore, such controlled movement must be connected to the recognition of various events in the environment, followed by only the correct movement in response. In other words, living organisms must use systems providing control and coordination. In keeping with the general principles of body organisation in multicellular organisms, specialised tissues are used to provide these control and coordination activities. 7.1 7.1 7.17.1ANIMALS NERVOUS SYSTEMANIMALS NERVOUS SYSTEMANIMALS NERVOUS SYSTEMANIMALS NERVOUS SYSTEMANIMALS NERVOUS SYSTEM In animals, such control and coordination are provided by ervous and muscular tissues, which we have studied  in Class IX. Touching a hot  Control and Coordination 81object is an urgent and dangerous situation for us. W e eed to detect it, and respond to it. How do we detect that we are touching a hot object? All information from our environment is detected by the specialised tips of some erve cells. These receptors are usually located in our sense organs, such as the inner ear , the ose, the tongue, and so on. So gustatory receptors will detect taste while olfactory receptors will detect smell. This information, acquired at the end of the dendritic tip of a erve cell [Fig. 7.1 (a)],  sets off a chemical reaction that creates an electrical impulse. This impulse travels from the dendrite to the cell body, and then along the axon to its end. At the end of the axon, the electrical impulse sets off the release of some chemicals. These chemicals cross the gap, or synapse, and start a similar electrical impulse in a dendrite of the ext 

- euron. This is a general scheme of how ervous impulses travel in the body. A similar synapse finally allows delivery of such impulses from eurons to other cells, such as muscles cells or gland  [Fig. 7.1 (b)]. It is thus o surprise that ervous tissue is made up of an organised etwork of erve cells or eurons, and is specialised for conducting information via electrical impulses fr om one part of the body to another . Look at Fig. 7.1 (a) and identify the parts of a euron (i) where information is acquired, (ii) through which information travels as an electrical impulse, and (iii) where this impulse must be converted into a chemical signal for onward transmi ssion. Activity 7.1 Put some sugar in your mouth. How does it taste? finger . Now eat sugar again. Is ther e any dif ference in its taste? 
- While eating lunch, block your ose in the same way and notice if you can fully appreciate the taste of the food you are eating. Is there a difference in how sugar and food taste if your ose is blocked? If so, why might this be happening? Read and talk about possible explanations for these kinds of differences. Do you come across a similar situation when you have a cold? Figure 7.1 (a) Structure of euron, (b)      Neuromuscular junction(a) (b)  

827.1.1 What happens in Reflex Actions? ‘Reflex’ is a word we use very commonly when we talk about some sudden action in r esponse to something in the envir onment. W e say ‘I jumped out of the way of the bus reflexly’, or ‘I pulled my hand back from the flame reflexly’, or ‘I was so hungry my mouth started watering reflexly’. What exactly do we mean? A common idea in all such examples is that we do something without thinking about it, or without feeling in control of our r eactions. Y et these ar e situations wher e we ar e responding with some action to changes in our environment. How is control and coordination achieved in such situations? Let us consider this further . Take one of our examples. T ouching a flame is an urgent and dangerous situation for us, or in fact, for any animal! How would we respond to this? One seemingly simple way is to think consciously about the pain and the possibility of getting burnt, and therefore move our hand. An important question then is, how long will it take us to think all this? The answer depends on how we think.  If erve impulses ar e sent ar ound the way we have talked about earlier , then thinking is also likely to involve the creation of such impulses. Thinking is a complex activity, so it is bound to involve a complicated interaction of many erve impulses from many eurons. If this is the case, it is o surprise that the thinking tissue in our body consists of dense etworks of intricately arranged eurons. It sits in the forward end of the skull, and receives signals from all over the body which it thinks about before responding to them. Obviously, in order to receive these signals, this thinking part of the brain in the skull must be connected to erves coming from various parts of the body. Similarly, if this part of the brain is to instruct muscles to move, 

- erves must carry this signal back to different parts of the body. If all of this is to be done when we touch a hot object, it may take enough time for us to get burnt! How does the design of the body solve this problem? Rather than having to think about the sensation of heat, if the erves that detect heat were to be connected to the erves that move muscles in a simpler way, the process of detecting the signal or the input and responding to it by an output action might be completed quickly. Such a connection is commonly called a reflex arc (Fig. 7.2). Where should such reflex arc connections be made between the input erve and the output erve? The best place, of course, would be at the point where they first meet each other . Nerves fr om all over the body meet in a bundle in the spinal cord on their way to the brain. Reflex arcs are formed in this spinal cord itself, although the information input also goes on to reach the brain. Of course, reflex arcs have evolved in animals because the thinking process of the brain is not fast enough.  In fact many animals have very little or one of the complex euron 
- etwork eeded for thinking. So it is quite likely that reflex arcs have evolved as efficient ways of functioning in the absence of true thought processes.  However , even after complex euron 
- etworks have come into existence, reflex arcs continue to be more efficient for quick responses.  Control and Coordination 83Can you ow trace the sequence of events which occur when a bright light is focussed on your eyes?",
        "

7.1.2 Human Brain": "Is reflex action the only function of the spinal cord? Obviously not, since we know that we are thinking beings. Spinal cord is made up of erves which supply information to think about. Thinking involves more complex mechanisms and eural connections. These are concentrated in the brain, which is the main coordinating centre of the body.  The brain and spinal cord constitute the central ervous system. They receive information from all parts of the body and integrate it. We also think about our actions. W riting, talking, moving a chair , clapping at the end of a programme are examples of voluntary actions which are based on deciding what to do ext.  So, the brain also has to send messages to muscles.  This is the second way in which the ervous system communicates with the muscles.  The communication between the central ervous system and the other parts of the body is facilitated by the peripheral ervous system consisting of cranial erves arising from the brain and spinal erves arising from the spinal cord. The brain thus allows us to think and take actions based on that thinking.  As you will expect, this is accomplished through a complex design, with different parts of the brain responsible for integrating different inputs and outputs. The brain has three such major parts or regions, 

- amely the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain. The forebrain is the main thinking part of the brain. It has regions which receive sensory impulses from various receptors. Separate areas of the forebrain are specialised for hearing, smell, sight and so on.  There are separate areas of association where this sensory information is interpreted by putting it together with information from other receptors as well as with information that is already stored in the brain.  Based onFigure 

7.2 Reflex arc  84all this, a decision is made about how to respond and the information is passed on to the motor areas which control the movement of voluntary muscles, for example, our leg muscles.  However , certain sensations ar e distinct from seeing or hearing, for example, how do we know that we have eaten enough? The sensation of feeling full is because of a centre associated with  hunger , which is in a separate part of the for ebrain. Study the labelled diagram of the human brain. W e have seen that the different parts have specific functions. Can we find out the function of each part? Let us look at the other use of the word ‘reflex’ that we have talked about in the introduction. Our mouth waters when we see food we like without our meaning to. Our hearts beat without our thinking about it. In fact, we cannot control these actions easily by thinking about them even if we wanted to. Do we have to think about or remember to breathe or digest food? So, in between the simple reflex actions like change in the size of the pupil, and the thought out actions such as moving a chair , ther e is another set of muscle movements over which we do not have any thinking control. Many of these involuntary actions are controlled by the midbrain and hindbrain. All these involuntary actions including blood pressure, salivation and vomiting are controlled by the medulla in the hindbrain. Think about activities like walking in a straight line, riding a bicycle, picking up a pencil. These are possible due to a part of the hindbrain called the cerebellum. It is responsible for precision of voluntary actions and maintaining the posture and balance of the body. Imagine what would happen if each of these events failed to take place if we were not thinking about it.Figure 7.3  Human brain  Control and Coordination 857.1.3 How are these Tissues protected? A delicate organ like the brain, which is so important for a variety of activities, 

- eeds to be carefully protected. For this, the body is designed so that the brain sits inside a bony box. Inside the box, the brain is contained in a fluidfilled balloon which provides further shock absorption. If you run your hand down the middle of your back, you will feel a hard, bumpy structure. This is the vertebral column or backbone which protects the spinal cord.",

7.1.4 How does the Nervous Tissue cause Action?": "So far , we have been talking about ervous tissue, and how it collects information, sends it around the body, processes information, makes decisions based on information, and conveys decisions to muscles for action. In other words, when the action or movement is to be performed, muscle tissue will do the final job. How do animal muscles move? When a erve impulse reaches the muscle, the muscle fibre must move. How does a muscle cell move? The simplest notion of movement at the cellular level is that muscle cells will move by changing their shape so that they shorten. So the ext question is, how do muscle cells change their shape? The answer must lie in the chemistry of cellular components. Muscle cells have special proteins that change both their shape and their arrangement in the cell in response to ervous electrical impulses. When this happens, 

- ew arrangements of these proteins give the muscle cells a shorter form. Remember when we talked about muscle tissue in Class IX, there were different kinds of muscles, such as voluntary muscles and involuntary muscles. Based on what we have discussed so far , what do you think the differences between these would be? QUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONS ?1. What is the difference between a reflex action and walking? 2. What happens at the synapse between two eurons? 3. Which part of the brain maintains posture and equilibrium of the body? 4.

7.2 COORDINA7.2 COORDINATIONINPLTIONPLANTSANTSANTS": "Animals have a ervous system for controlling and coordinating the activities of the body. But plants have either a ervous system or muscles. So, how do they respond to stimuli? When we touch the leaves of a chhuimui  (the ‘sensitive’ or ‘touchme-

- ot’ plant of the Mimosa family), they begin to fold up and droop. When a seed germinates, the root goes down, the stem comes up into the air . What happens? Firstly, the leaves of the sensitive plant move very quickly in response to touch.  86There is o growth involved in this movement. On the other hand, the directional movement of a seedling is caused by growth. If it is prevented from growing, it will not show any movement. So plants show two different types of movement one dependent on growth and the other independent of growth.",
        "

7.2.1 Immediate Response to Stimulus": "Let us think about the first kind of movement, such as that of the sensitive plant. Since o growth is involved, the plant must actually move its leaves in response to touch. But there is o 

- ervous tissue, 
- or any muscle tissue. How does the plant detect the touch, and how do the leaves move in response? Figure 7.4Figure 

7.4  The sensitive plant If we think about where exactly the plant is touched, and what part of the plant actually moves, it is apparent that movement happens at a point different from the point of touch. So, information that a touch has occurred must be communicated. The plants also use electricalchemical means to convey this information from cell to cell, but unlike in animals, there is o specialised tissue in plants for the conduction of information. Finally, again as in animals, some cells must change shape in order for movement to happen. Instead of the specialised proteins found in animal muscle cells, plant cells change shape by changing the amount of water in them, resulting in swelling or shrinking, and therefore in changing shapes.",

        "

7.2.2 Movement Due to Growth": "Some plants like the pea plant climb up other plants or fences by means of tendrils. These tendrils are sensitive to touch. When they come in contact with any support, the part of the tendril in contact with the object does not grow as rapidly as the part of the tendril away from the object. This causes the tendril to circle around the object and thus cling to it. More commonly, plants respond to stimuli slowly by growing in a particular direction. Because this growth is directional, it appears as if the plant is moving. Let us understand this type of movement with the help of an example.  Control and Coordination 87Environmental triggers such as light, or gravity will change the directions that plant parts grow in. These directional, or tropic, movements can be either towards the stimulus, or away from it. So, in two different kinds of phototropic movement, shoots respond by bending towards light while roots respond by bending away from it. How does this help the plant? Plants show tropism in response to other stimuli as well. The roots of a plant always grow downwards while the shoots usually grow upwards and away from the earth. This upward and downward growth of shoots and roots, respectively, in response to the pull of earth or gravity is, obviously, geotropism (Fig. 7.6). If ‘hydro’ means water and ‘chemo’ refers to chemicals, what would ‘hydrotropism’ and ‘chemotropism’ mean? Can we think of examples of these kinds of directional growth movements? One example of chemotropism is the growth of pollen tubes towards ovules, about which we will learn more when we examine the reproductive processes of living organisms. Let us ow once again think about how information is communicated in the bodies of multicellular organisms. The movement of the sensitive plant in response to touch is very quick. The movement of sunflowers in response to day or ight, on the other hand, is quite slow. Growthr elated movement of plants will be even slower . Even in animal bodies, there are carefully controlled directions to growth. Our arms and fingers grow in certain directions, 

- ot haphazardly. So controlled movements can be either slow or fast. If fast responses to stimuli are to be made, information transfer must happen very quickly. For this, the medium of transmission must be able to move rapidly.Activity 7.2 Fill a conical flask with water . 
- Cover the eck of the flask with a wire mesh. 
- Keep two or three freshly germinated bean seeds on the wire mesh. 
- Take a cardboard box which is open from one side. 
- Keep the flask in the box in such a manner that the open side of the box faces light coming from a window (Fig. 7.5). 
- After two or three days, you will notice that the shoots bend towards light and roots away from light. 
- Now turn the flask so that the shoots are away from light and the roots towards light. Leave it undisturbed in this condition for a few days. 
- Have the old parts of the shoot and root changed direction? 
- Are there differences in the direction of the ew growth? 
- What can we conclude from this activity? Figure 7.5Figure 

7.5 Response of the plant to the direction of light Figure 7.6 Plant showing geotropism  88Electrical impulses are an excellent means for this. But there are limitations to the use of electrical impulses. Firstly, they will reach only those cells that are connected by ervous tissue, 

- ot each and every cell in the animal body. Secondly, once an electrical impulse is generated in a cell and transmitted, the cell will take some time to reset its mechanisms before it can generate and transmit a ew impulse. In other words, cells cannot continually create and transmit electrical impulses. It is thus o wonder that most multicellular organisms use another means of communication between cells, 
- amely, chemical communication. If, instead of generating an electrical impulse, stimulated cells release a chemical compound, this compound would diffuse all around the original cell. If other cells around have the means to detect this compound using special molecules on their surfaces, then they would be able to recognise infor mation, and even transmit it. This will be slower , of course, but it can potentially reach all cells of the body, regardless of ervous connections, and it can be done steadily and persistently. These compounds, or hormones used by multicellular organisms for control and coordination show a great deal of diversity, as we would expect. Different plant hormones help to coordinate growth, development and responses to the environment. They are synthesised at places away from where they act and simply diffuse to the area of action. Let us take an example that we have worked with earlier [Activity 7.2]. When growing plants detect light, a hormone called auxin, synthesised at the shoot tip, helps the cells to gr ow longer . When light is coming fr om one side of the plant, auxin diffuses towards the shady side of the shoot. This concentration of auxin stimulates the cells to grow longer on the side of the shoot which is away from light. Thus, the plant appears to bend towards light. Another example of plant hormones are gibberellins which, like auxins, help in the growth of the stem. Cytokinins promote cell division, and it is atural then that they are present in greater concentration in areas of rapid cell division, such as in fruits and seeds. These are examples of plant hormones that help in promoting growth. But plants also eed signals to stop growing. Abscisic acid is one example of a hormone which inhibits growth. Its effects include wilting of leaves. QUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONS ?1. What are plant hormones? 2. How is the movement of leaves of the sensitive plant different from the movement of a shoot towards light? 3. Give an example of a plant hormone that promotes growth. 4. How do auxins promote the growth of a tendril around a support? 5. Design an experiment to demonstrate hydrotropism.  Control and Coordination 

897.3 HORMONESINANIMALS7.3 HORMONESINANIMALS7.3 HORMONESINANIMALS7.3 HORMONESINANIMALS7.3 HORMONESINANIMALSHow are such chemical, or hormonal, means of information transmission used in animals? What do some animals, for instance squirrels, experience when they are in a scary situation? Their bodies have to prepare for either fighting or running away. Both are very complicated activities that will use a great deal of energy in controlled ways. Many different tissue types will be used and their activities integrated together in these actions. However , the two alter ate activities, fighting or running, are also quite different! So here is a situation in which some common preparations can be usefully made in the body. These preparations should ideally make it easier to do either activity in the ear future. How would this be achieved? If the body design in the squirrel relied only on electrical impulses via erve cells, the range of tissues instructed to prepare for the coming activity would be limited. On the other hand, if a chemical signal were to be sent as well, it would reach all cells of the body and provide the wideranging changes eeded. This is done in many animals, including human beings, using a hormone called adrenaline that is secreted from the adrenal glands. Look at Fig. 7.7 to locate these glands. Adrenaline is secreted directly into the blood and carried to different parts of the body. The target organs or the specific tissues on which it acts include the heart. As a r esult, the heart beats faster , resulting in supply of more oxygen to our muscles. The blood to the digestive system and skin is reduced due to contraction of muscles around small arteries in these organs. This diverts the blood to our skeletal muscles. The breathing rate also increases because of the contractions of the diaphragm and the rib muscles. All these responses together enable the animal body to be ready to deal with the situation. Such animal hormones are part of the endocrine system which constitutes a second way of control and coordination in our body. Activity 7.3 Look at Fig. 7.7. 

- Identify the endocrine glands mentioned in the figure. 
- Some of these glands have been listed in Table 7.1 and discussed in the text. Consult books in the library and discuss with your teachers to find out about other glands. Remember that plants have hormones that control their directional growth. What functions do animal hormones perform? On the face of it, we cannot imagine their r ole in dir ectional gr owth. W e have ever seen an animal growing mor e in one dir ection or the other , depending on light or gravity! But if we think about it a bit more, it will become evident that, even in animal bodies, growth happens in carefully controlled places. Plants will grow leaves in many places on the plant body, for example. But we do not grow fingers on our faces. The design of the body is carefully maintained even during the growth of children.  90Let us examine some examples to understand how hormones help in coor dinated gr owth. W e have all seen salt packets which say ‘iodised salt’ or ‘enriched with iodine’. Why is it important for us to have iodised salt in our diet? Iodine is ecessary for the thyroid gland to make thyroxin hormone. Thyroxin regulates carbohydrate, protein and fat metabolism in the body so as to provide the best balance for growth. Iodine is essential for the synthesis of thyroxin. In case iodine is deficient in our diet, there is a possibility that we might suffer from goitre. One of the symptoms in this disease is a swollen eck. Can you correlate this with the position of the thyroid gland in Fig. 7.7? Sometimes we come across people who are either very short (dwarfs) or extremely tall (giants). Have you ever wondered how this happens? Growth hormone is one of the hormones secreted by the pituitary. As its ame indicates, growth hormone regulates growth and development of the body. If there is a deficiency of this hormone in childhood, it leads to dwarfism. You must have noticed many dramatic changes in your appearance as well as that of your friends as you approached 10 12 years of age. These changes associated with puberty are because of the secretion of testosterone in males and oestrogen in females. Do you know anyone in your family or friends who has been advised by the doctor to take less sugar in their diet because they are suffering from diabetes? As a treatment, they might be taking injections of insulin. This is a hormone which is produced by the pancreas and helps in regulating blood sugar levels. If it is not secreted in proper amounts, the sugar level in the blood rises causing many harmful effects. Figure 

7.7 Endocrine glands in human beings (a) male, (b) female (a) (b) Do You Know? Hypothalamus plays an important role in the release of many hormones. For example, when the level of growth hormone is low, the hypothalamus releases growth hormone releasing factor which stimulates the pituitary gland to release growth hormone.  Control and Coordination 91If it is so important that hormones should be secreted in precise quantities, we eed a mechanism through which this is done. The timing and amount of hormone released are regulated by feedback mechanisms. For example, if the sugar levels in blood rise, they are detected by the cells of the pancreas which respond by producing more insulin. As the blood sugar level falls, insulin secretion is reduced.

12 CHAPTER Electricity has an important place in modern society. It is a controllable and convenient form of energy for a variety of uses in homes, schools, hospitals, industries and so on. What constitutes electricity? How does it flow in an electric circuit? What are the factors that control or regulate the curr ent thr ough an electric cir cuit? In this Chapter , we shall attempt to answer such questions. W e shall also discuss the heating ef fect of electric current and its applications.",

12.1 ELECTRICCURRENTANDCIRCUIT12.1 CIRCUIT": "We are familiar with air curr ent and water curr ent. W e know that flowing water constitute water current in rivers. Similarly, if the electric charge flows through a conductor (for example, through a metallic wire), we say that ther e is an electric curr ent in the conductor . In a tor ch, we know that the cells (or a battery, when placed in proper order) provide flow of char ges or an electric curr ent thr ough the tor ch bulb to glow. W e have also seen that the torch gives light only when its switch is on. What does a switch do? A switch makes a conducting link between the cell and the bulb. A continuous and closed path of an electric current is called an electric circuit. Now, if the circuit is broken anywhere (or the switch of the torch is turned off), the current stops flowing and the bulb does not glow. How do we express electric current? Electric current is expressed by the amount of charge flowing through a particular area in unit time. In other words, it is the rate of flow of electric charges. In circuits using metallic wir es, electr ons constitute the flow of char ges. However , electr ons were not known at the time when the phenomenon of electricity was first observed. So, electric current was considered to be the flow of positive charges and the direction of flow of positive charges was taken to be the direction of electric current. Conventionally, in an electric circuit the direction of electric current is taken as opposite to the direction of the flow of electrons, which are egative charges.  94If a et charge Q, flows across any crosssection of a conductor in time t, then the current I, through the crosssection is IQ t= (12.1) The SI unit of electric charge is coulomb (C), which is equivalent to the char ge contained in early 6 ´ 1018 electr ons. (W e know that an electron possesses a egative charge of 1.6 ´ 10 19 C.) The electric current is expressed by a unit called ampere (A), 

- amed after the French scientist, AndreMarie Ampere (1775 1836). One ampere is constituted by the flow of one coulomb of charge per second, that is, 

1 A = 1 C/1 s. Small quantities of current are expressed in milliampere (1 mA = 10 3 A) or in microampere (1 m A = 10 6 A). An instrument called ammeter measures electric current in a circuit. It is always connected in series in a circuit through which the current is to be measured. Figure 12.1 shows the schematic diagram of a typical electric circuit comprising a cell, an electric bulb, an ammeter and a plug key. Note that the electric current flows in the circuit from the positive ter minal of the cell to the egative terminal of the cell thr ough the bulb and ammeter .

Let us consider the analogy of flow of water . Char ges do not flow in a copper wir e by themselves, just as water in a perfectly horizontal tube does not flow. If one end of the tube is connected to a tank of water kept at a higher level, such that there is a pressure difference between the two ends of the tube, water flows out of the other end of the tube. For flow of charges in a conducting metallic wire, the gravity, of course, has o role to play; the electrons move only if there is a difference of electric pressure called the potential differenc e along the conductor . This dif ference of potential may be pr oduced by a battery, consisting of one or more electric cells. The chemical action within a cell generates the potential difference across the terminals of the cell, even when o current is drawn from it. When the cell is connected to a conducting circuit element, the potential difference sets the charges in motion in the conductor and produces an electric current. In order to maintain the current in a given electric circuit, the cell has to expend its chemical energy stored in it. We define the electric potential dif ference between two points in an electric circuit carrying some current as the work done to move a unit charge from one point to the other Potential dif ference ( V) between two points = Work done ( W)/Char ge (Q) V=W/Q (12.2) The SI unit of electric potential difference is volt (V), 

- amed after Alessandro V olta (174 5 1827), an Italian physicist. One volt is the‘Flow’ of charges inside a wire‘Flow’ of charges inside a wire‘Flow’ of charges inside a wire‘Flow’ of charges inside a wire‘Flow’ of charges inside a wire How does a metal conduct electricity? Y ou would think that a lowener gy electr on would have gr eat dif ficulty passing thr ough a solid conductor . Inside the solid, the atoms are packed together with very little spacing between them. But it turns out that the electrons are able to ‘travel’ through a perfect solid crystal smoothly and easily, almost as if they were in a vacuum. The ‘motion’ of electr ons in a conductor , however , is very dif ferent fr om that of char ges in empty space. When a steady curr ent flows thr ough a conductor , the electr ons in it move with a certain average ‘drift speed’. One can calculate this drift speed of electrons for a typical copper wire carrying a small current, and it is found to be actually very small, of the order of 1 mm s1. How is it then that an electric bulb lights up as soon as we turn the switch on? It cannot be that a current starts only when an electron from one terminal of the electric supply physically reaches the other terminal through the bulb, because the physical drift of electrons in the conducting wires is a very slow process. The exact mechanism of the current flow, which takes place with a speed close to the speed of light, is fascinating, but it is beyond the scope of this book.

12.4 OHM’S LA12.4 LAWWW": "Is there a relationship between the potential difference across a conductor and the current through it? Let us explore with an Activity. Activity 12.1 Set up a circuit as shown in Fig. 12.2, consisting of a ichrome wire XY of length, say 0.5  m, an ammeter , a voltmeter and four cells of 1.5 V each. (Nichr ome is an alloy of ickel, chr omium, manganese, and iron metals.)  98Figure 12.3 V I graph for a ichrome wire. A straight line plot shows that as the current through a wire increases, the potential difference across the wire increases linearly this is Ohm’s law.S. Number of cells Current through Potential difference V/I No. used in the ichrome across the (volt/ampere) circuit wire, I ichrome (ampere) wire, V (volt) 1 2 3 4 In this Activity, you will find that approximately the same value for V/I is obtained in each case. Thus the V I graph is a straight line that passes through the origin of the graph, as shown in Fig. 12.3. Thus, V/I is a constant ratio. In 1827, a German physicist Georg Simon Ohm (1787 1854) found out the relationship between the current I, flowing in a metallic wire and the potential difference across its terminals. The potential difference, V, across the ends of a given metallic wire in an electric circuit is directly proportional to the current flowing through it,  provided its temperature remains the same. This is called Ohm’s law. In other words V ∝ I (12.4) or V/I =constant =R or V =IR (12.5) In Eq. (12.4), R is a constant for the given metallic wire at a given temperature and is called its resistance. It is the property of a conductor to resist the flow of chargesFigure 12.2  Electric circuit for studying Ohm’s lawnFirst use only one cell as the source in the circuit. Note the reading in the ammeter I, for the current and reading of the voltmeter V for the potential difference across the ichrome wire XY in the circuit. Tabulate them in the Table given. 

- Next connect two cells in the circuit and note the respective readings of the ammeter and voltmeter for the values of current through the ichrome wire and potential difference across the ichrome wire. 
- Repeat the above steps using three cells and then four cells in the circuit separately. 
- Calculate the ratio of V to I for each pair of potential difference V and current I. 
- Plot a graph between V and I, and observe the ature of the graph.  Electricity 99through it. Its SI unit is ohm, r epresented by the Gr eek letter Ω. Accor ding to Ohm’s law, R = V/I (12.6) If the potential difference across the two ends of a conductor is 

1 V and the current through it is 1 A, then the resistance R, of the conductor is 1 Ω. That is, 1 ohm = 1 volt 1 ampere Also from Eq. (12.5) we get I = V/R (12.7) It is obvious from Eq. (12.7) that the current through a resistor is inversely proportional to its resistance. If the resistance is doubled the current gets halved. In many practical cases it is ecessary to increase or decrease the current in an electric circuit. A component used to regulate current without changing the voltage source is called variable resistance. In an electric circuit, a device called rheostat is often used to change the r esistance in the cir cuit. W e will ow study about electrical resistance of a conductor with the help of following Activity. Activity 12.2 Take a ichrome wire, a torch bulb, a 10 W bulb and an ammeter (0 5 A range), a plug key and some connecting wires. 

- Set up the circuit by connecting four dry cells of 

1.5 V each in series with the ammeter leaving a gap XY in the circuit, as shown in Fig. 12.4. Figure 12.4 Complete the cir cuit by connecting the ichr ome wir e in the gap XY . Plug the key. Note down the ammeter reading. Take out the key from the plug. [Note:  Always take out the key from the plug after measuring the current through the circuit. ] 

- Replace the ichrome wire with the torch bulb in the circuit and find the current through it by measuring the reading of the ammeter . 
- Now r epeat the above step with the 

10 W bulb in the gap XY . 

- Are the ammeter readings different for different components connected in the gap XY? What do the above observations indicate? 
- You may r epeat this Activity by keeping any material component in the gap. Observe the ammeter readings in each case. Analyse the observations. In this Activity we observe that the current is different for different components. Why do they differ? Certain components offer an easy path for the flow of electric current while the others resist the flow. W e know  100that motion of electrons in an electric circuit constitutes an electric current. The electr ons, however , are not completely fr ee to move within a conductor . They ar e restrained by the attraction of the atoms among which they move. Thus, motion of electrons through a conductor is retarded by its resistance. A component of a given size that offers a low resistance is a good conductor . A conductor having some appr eciable resistance is called a r esistor . A component of identical size that of fers a higher r esistance is a poor conductor .

- Replace the ichrome wire by another ichrome wire of same thickness but twice the length, that is 2 l [marked (2) in the Fig. 12.5]. 
- Note the ammeter reading. 
- Now replace the wire by a thicker ichrome wire, of the same length l [marked (3)]. A thicker wire has a larger crosssectional area. Again note down the current through the circuit. 
- Instead of taking a ichrome wire, connect a copper wire [marked (4) in Fig. 12.5] in the circuit. Let the wire be of the same length and same area of crosssection as that of the first ichrome wire [marked (1)]. Note the value of the current. 
- Notice the difference in the current in all cases. 
- Does the current depend on the length of the conductor? 
- Does the current depend on the area of crosssection of the wire used? It is observed that the ammeter reading decreases to onehalf when the length of the wire is doubled. The ammeter reading is increased when a thicker wire of the same material and of the same length is used in the circuit. A change in ammeter reading is observed when a wire of different material of the same length and the same area of crosssection is used. On applying Ohm’s law [Eqs. (12.5) (12.7)], we observe that the  Electricity 101resistance of the conductor depends (i) on its length, (ii) on its area of crosssection, and (iii) on the ature of its material. Precise measurements have shown that resistance of a uniform metallic conductor is directly proportional to its length ( l) and inversely proportional to the area of crosssection ( A). That is, R µ l (12.8) and R µ 1/A (12.9) Combining Eqs. (12.8) and (12.9) we get R µ l A or, R = rl A(12.10) where r (rho) is a constant of proportionality and is called the electrical resistivity of the material of the conductor . The SI unit of r esistivity is W m. It is a characteristic property of the material. The metals and alloys have very low resistivity in the  range of 10 

8 W m to  10 6 W m. They are good conductors of electricity. Insulators like rubber and glass have resistivity of the order of 1012 to 1017 W m. Both the resistance and resistivity of a material vary with temperature. Table 12.2 reveals that the resistivity of an alloy is generally higher than that of its constituent metals. Alloys do not oxidise (bur ) readily at high temperatures. For this reason, they are commonly used in electrical heating devices, like electric iron, toasters etc. Tungsten is used almost exclusively for filaments of electric bulbs, whereas copper and aluminium are generally used for electrical transmission lines.

W e have noticed how the current through a conductor depends upon its resistance and the potential difference across its ends. In various electrical gadgets, we often use r esistors in various combinations. W e ow ther efore intend to see how Ohm’s law can be applied to combinations of resistors. There are two methods of joining the r esistors together . Figur e 12.6 shows an electric circuit in which three resistors having resistances R1, R2 and R3, respectively, are joined end to end. Here the resistors are said to be connected in series.R2 =l/2 2Ar  =1 41 ArR1 =1 A=4Wr R2 = R11 4  104Figure 12.7  Resistors in parallelFigure 12.6  Resistors in series Figure 12.7 shows a combination of resistors in which three resistors are connected together between points X and Y . Here, the resistors are said to be connected in parallel. Activity 12.4 Join three resistors of different values in series. Connect them with a battery, an ammeter and a plug key, as shown in Fig. 12.6. You may use the r esistors of values like 1 Ω, 2 Ω, 3 Ω etc., and a battery of 6 V for performing this Activity. 

- Plug the key. Note the ammeter reading. 
- Change the position of ammeter to anywhere in between the resistors. Note the ammeter reading each time. 
- Do you find any change in the value of current through the ammeter?

12.6.1 Resistors in Series What happens to the value of current when a umber of resistors are connected in series in a circuit? What would be their equivalent resistance? Let us try to understand these with the help of the following activities.  Electricity 105You will observe that the value of the curr ent in the ammeter is the same, independent of its position in the electric circuit. It means that in a series combination of resistors the current is the same in every part of the cir cuit or the same curr ent thr ough each r esistor . Activity 12.5 In Activity 12.4, insert a voltmeter across the ends X and Y of the series combination of three resistors, as shown in Fig. 12.6. 

- Plug the key in the circuit and note the voltmeter reading. It gives the potential difference across the series combination of resistors. Let it be V. Now measure the potential dif ference acr oss the two terminals of the battery. Compare the two values. 
- Take out the plug key and disconnect the voltmeter . Now insert the voltmeter acr oss the ends X and P of the first r esistor , as shown in Fig. 12.8. Figure 12.8 Plug the key and measure the potential difference across the first resistor . Let it be V1. 
- Similarly, measure the potential difference across the other two resistors, separately. Let these values be V2 and V3, respectively. 
- Deduce a r elationship between V, V1, V2 and V3. You will observe that the potential dif ference V is equal to the sum of potential differences V1, V2, and V3. That is the total potential difference across a combination of resistors in series is equal to the sum of potential difference across the individual resistors. That is, V = V1 + V2  + V3(12.11) In the electric circuit shown in Fig. 12.8, let I be the current through the circuit. The current through each resistor is also I. It is possible to replace the three resistors joined in series by an equivalent single resistor of resistance R, such that the potential difference V across it, and the current I through the circuit remains the same. Applying the Ohm’s law to the entire circuit, we have V = I R (12.12)  106On applying Ohm’s law to the three resistors separately, we further have V1=I R1[12.13(a)] V2=I R2[12.13(b)] and V3=I R3[12.13(c)] From Eq. (12.11), I R= I R1 + I R2 + I R3 or Rs= R1 +R2 + R3(12.14) We can conclude that when several r esistors ar e joined in series, the resistance of the combination Rs equals the sum of their individual resistances, R1, R2, R3, and is thus greater than any individual resistance.

Then the total resistance in the circuit R= R1 + R2 Rs=20 Ω + 4 Ω = 24 Ω. The total potential difference across the two terminals of the battery V = 6 V . Now by Ohm’s law, the current through the circuit is given by I=V/Rs =6 V/24 Ω =0.25 A.Figure 12.9  An electric lamp connected in series with a resistor of 4 Ω to a 6 V battery  Electricity 107Applying Ohm’s law to the electric lamp and conductor separately, we get potential difference across the electric lamp, V1=20 Ω × 0.25 A =5 V; and, that acr oss the conductor , V2  =  4 Ω  × 0.25 A =  1 V . Suppose that we like to replace the series combination of electric lamp and conductor by a single and equivalent r esistor . Its resistance must be such that a potential difference of 6 V across the battery terminals will cause a current of 0.25 A in the circuit.

12.6.2 Resistors in Parallel": "Now, let us consider the arrangement of three resistors joined in parallel with a combination of cells (or a battery), as shown in Fig.12.7.

Also connect a voltmeter in parallel with the combination of resistors. 

- Plug the key and note the ammeter reading. Let the current be I. Also take the voltmeter reading. It gives the potential dif ference V, across the combination. The potential difference acr oss each r esistor is also V. This can be checked by connecting the voltmeter across each individual resistor (see Fig. 12.11).Figure 12.10  108nTake out the plug from the key. Remove the ammeter and voltmeter from the circuit. Insert the ammeter in series with the resistor R1, as shown in Fig. 12.11. Note the ammeter reading, I1. Figure 12.11 Similarly, measure the currents through R2 and R3. Let these be I2 and I3, respectively. What is the relationship between I, I1, I2 and I3? It is observed that the total current I, is equal to the sum of the separate currents through each branch of the combination. I = I1 + I2 + I3(12.15) Let Rp be the equivalent resistance of the parallel combination of resistors. By applying Ohm’s law to the parallel combination of resistors, we have I = V/Rp(12.16) On applying Ohm’s law to each resistor , we have I1 = V /R1;    I2 = V /R2; and I3 = V /R3(12.17) From Eqs. (12.15) to (12.17), we have V/Rp = V/R1 + V/R2 + V/R3 or 1/Rp = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3(12.18) Thus, we may conclude that the reciprocal of the equivalent resistance of a group of resistances joined in parallel is equal to the sum of the reciprocals of the individual resistances.

Potential dif ference acr oss the battery, V = 12 V . This is also the potential difference across each of the individual resistor; therefore, to calculate the current in the resistors, we use Ohm’s law. The current  I1, through R1 = V/ R1 I1=12 V/5 Ω  = 2.4 A.  Electricity 109The current  I2, through R2=V/ R2 I2=12 V/10 W =1.2 A. The current  I3, through R3=V/R3 I3=12 V/30 W =0.4 A.

Solution SolutionSolution Suppose we replace the parallel resistors R1 and R2 by an equivalent resistor of resistance, R¢. Similarly we replace the parallel resistors R3, R4 and R5 by an equivalent single resistor of resistance R². Then using Eq. (12.18), we have 1/ R¢ = 1/10 + 1/40 =5/40; that is R¢  = 8 W. Similarly, 1/ R²=1/30 + 1/20 + 1/60 = 6/60; that is, R²  = 10 W. Thus, the total resistance, R = R¢ + R² = 18 W. To calculate the current, we use Ohm’s law, and get I = V/R = 12 V/18 W = 0.67 A. We have seen that in a series cir cuit the curr ent is constant throughout the electric circuit. Thus it is obviously impracticable to connect an electric bulb and an electric heater in series, because they eed currents of widely different values to operate properly (see Example 12.3). Another major disadvantage of a series circuit is that when one component fails the circuit is broken and one of the components works. If you have used ‘fairy lights’ to decorate buildings on festivals, on marriage celebrations etc., you might have seen the electrician spending lot of time in troublelocating and replacing the ‘dead’ bulb each has to be tested to find which has fused or gone. On the other hand, a parallel circuit divides the current through the electrical gadgets. The total resistance in a parallel circuit is decreased as per Eq. (12.18). This is helpful particularly when each gadget has different resistance and requires different current to operate properly.Figure 12.12 An electric circuit showing the combination of series and parallel resistors1 Rp =1 51 10+1 30+1 3=  11012.7 HEA",

12.7 HEA 12.7 TINGEFFECTOFELECTRICCURRENTTINGCURRENT": "We know that a battery or a cell is a sour ce of electrical ener gy. The chemical reaction within the cell generates the potential difference between its two terminals that sets the electrons in motion to flow the current through a r esistor or a system of r esistors connected to the battery. W e have also seen, in Section 12.2, that to maintain the current, the source has to keep expending its energy. Where does this energy go? A part of the source energy in maintaining the current may be consumed into useful work (like in rotating the blades of an electric fan). Rest of the source energy may be expended in heat to raise the temperature of gadget. W e often observe this in our everyday life. For example, an electric fan becomes warm if used continuously for longer time etc. On the other hand, if the electric circuit is purely resistive, that is, a configuration of resistors only connected to a battery; the source energy continually gets dissipated entirely in the form of heat. This is known as the heating effect of electric current. This effect is utilised in devices such as electric heater , electric ir on etc. Consider a current I flowing through a resistor of resistance R. Let the potential difference across it be  V (Fig. 12.13). Let t be the time during which a charge Q flows across. The work done in moving the charge Q through a potential difference V is VQ. Therefore, the source must supply energy equal to VQ in time t. Hence the power input to the circuit by the source is P V VI =Q t= (12.19) Or the energy supplied to the circuit by the source in time t is P × t, that is, VIt. What happens to this energy expended by the source? This energy gets dissipated in the resistor as heat. Thus for a steady current  I, the amount of heat H produced in time t is H = VIt (12.20)QUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONS ?1.

In many cases, it is undesirable as it converts useful electrical energy into heat. In electric circuits, the unavoidable heating can increase the temperatur e of the components and alter their pr operties. However , heating effect of electric current has many useful applications. The electric laundry ir on, electric toaster , electric oven, electric kettle and electric heater are some of the familiar devices based on Joule’s heating. The electric heating is also used to produce light, as in an electric bulb. Here, the filament must retain as much of the heat generated as is possible, so that it gets very hot and emits light. It must not melt at such high temperature. A strong metal with high melting point such as tungsten (melting point 3380°C) is used for making bulb filaments. The filament should be ther mally isolated as much as possible, using insulating support, etc. The bulbs are usually filled with chemically inactive itrogen and argon gases to prolong the life of filament. Most of the power consumed by the filament appears as heat, but a small part of it is in the form of light radiated. Another common application of Joule’s heating is the fuse  used in electric circuits. It protects circuits and appliances by stopping the flow of any unduly high electric current. The fuse is placed in series with the device. It consists of a piece of wire made of a metal or an alloy of appropriate melting point, for example aluminium, copper , iron, lead etc. If a current larger than the specified value flows through the circuit, the temperature of the fuse wire increases. This melts the fuse wire and breaks the circuit. The fuse wire is usually encased in a cartridge of porcelain or similar material with metal ends. The fuses used for domestic purposes are rated as 1 A, 2 A, 3 A, 5 A, 10 A, etc. For an electric iron which consumes 1 kW electric power when operated at 220 V, a current of (1000/220) A, that is, 4.54 A will flow in the circuit. In this case, a 5 A fuse must be used.QUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONS ?1. Why does the cord of an electric heater not glow while the heating element does? 2.

This is also the rate of consumption of ener gy. Equation (12.21) gives the rate at which electric energy is dissipated or consumed in an electric cir cuit. This is also ter med as electric power . The power P is given by P  =  VI Or P  =  I2R = V2/R (12.22) The SI unit of electric power is watt (W). It is the power consumed by a device that carries 1 A of current when operated at a potential difference of 1 V . Thus, 1 W  =  1 volt ´  1 ampere = 1 V A (12.23) The unit ‘watt’ is very small. Therefore, in actual practice we use a much larger unit called ‘kilowatt’. It is equal to 1000 watts. Since electrical energy is the product of power and time, the unit of electric energy is, therefore, watt hour (W h). One watt hour is the energy consumed when 1 watt of power is used for 1 hour . The commer cial unit of electric energy is kilowatt hour (kW h), commonly known as ‘unit’. 1 kW h =1000 watt ´ 3600 second =3.6 ´ 106 watt second =3.6 ´ 106 joule (J)More to Know!Many people think that electrons are consumed in an electric circuit. This is wrong! We pay the electricity boar d or electric company to pr ovide energy to move electr ons through the electric gadgets like electric bulb, fan and engines.

What y ou hav e learnt A stream of electrons moving through a conductor constitutes an electric current. Conventionally, the direction of current is taken opposite to the direction of flow of electrons. 

- The SI unit of electric current is ampere. 
- To set the electrons in motion in an electric circuit, we use a cell or a battery. A cell generates a potential difference across its terminals. It is measured in volts (V). 
- Resistance is a pr operty that r esists the flow of electr ons in a conductor . It contr ols the magnitude of the current. The SI unit of resistance is ohm ( W). 
- Ohm’s law: The potential difference across the ends of a resistor is directly proportional to the current through it, provided its temperature remains the same. 
- The resistance of a conductor depends directly on its length, inversely on its area of crosssection, and also on the material of the conductor . 
- The equivalent resistance of several resistors in series is equal to the sum of their individual resistances. 
- A set of resistors connected in parallel has an equivalent resistance Rp given by The electrical energy dissipated in a resistor is given by W = V ´ I ´ t The unit of power is watt (W). One watt of power is consumed when

Magnetic Effects of Electric Current13 CHAPTER In the previous Chapter on ‘Electricity’ we learnt about the heating effects of electric current. What could be the other effects of electric current? W e know that an electric curr entcarrying wir e behaves like a magnet. Let us perform the following Activity to reinforce it. Activity 13.1 Take a straight thick copper wire and place it between the points X and Y in an electric circuit, as shown in Fig. 13.1. The wire XY is kept perpendicular to the plane of paper . 

- Horizontally place a small compass ear to this copper wire. See the position of its eedle. 
- Pass the current through the circuit by inserting the key into the plug. 
- Observe the change in the position of the compass eedle.Figure 13.1Figure 

13.1 Compass eedle is deflected on passing an electric current through a metallic conductor We see that the eedle is deflected. What does it mean?  It means that the electric current through the copper wire has produced a magnetic effect. Thus we can say that electricity and magnetism are linked to each other . Then, what about the r everse possibility of an electric ef fect of moving magnets? In this Chapter we will study magnetic fields and such electr omagnetic ef fects. W e shall also study about electr omagnets and electric motors which involve the magnetic effect of electric current, and electric generators which involve the electric effect of moving magnets.

In 1820 he accidentally discovered that a compass eedle got deflected when an electric current passed through a metallic wire placed earby. Through this observation Oersted showed that electricity and magnetism were related phenomena. His research later created technologies such as the radio, television and fiber optics. The unit of magnetic field str ength is amed the oersted in his honor .Resistor Long straight conductor  11813.1 MAGNETICFIELDANDFIELDLINES13.1 MAGNETICFIELDANDFIELDLINES13.1 MAGNETICFIELDANDFIELDLINES13.1 MAGNETICFIELDANDFIELDLINES13.1 MAGNETICFIELDANDFIELDLINESWe are familiar with the fact that a compass eedle gets deflected when brought ear a bar magnet. A compass eedle is, in fact, a small bar magnet. The ends of the compass eedle point approximately towards orth and south directions. The end pointing towards orth is called orth seeking  or orth pole. The other end that points towards south is called south seeking  or south pole. Through various activities we have observed that like poles r epel, while unlike poles of magnets attract each other . QUESTIONQUESTIONQUESTIONQUESTIONQUESTION ?1. Why does a compass eedle get deflected when brought ear a bar magnet? Activity 13.2 Fix a sheet of white paper on a drawing board using some adhesive material. 

- Place a bar magnet in the centre of it. 
- Sprinkle some iron filings uniformly around the bar magnet (Fig. 13.2). A saltsprinkler may be used for this purpose. 
- Now tap the board gently. 
- What do you observe? Figure 13.2Figure 

13.2 Iron filings ear the bar magnet align themselves along the field lines. The iron filings arrange themselves in a pattern as shown Fig. 13.2.  Why do the iron filings arrange in such a pattern? What does this pattern demonstrate?  The magnet exerts its influence in the region surrounding it.  Therefore the iron filings experience a force.  The force thus exerted makes iron filings to arrange in a pattern. The region surrounding a magnet, in which the force of the magnet can be detected, is said to have a magnetic field.  The lines along which the iron filings align themselves represent magnetic field lines. Are there other ways of obtaining magnetic field lines around a bar magnet?  Y es, you can yourself draw the field lines of a bar magnet. Activity 13.3 Take a small compass and a bar magnet. 

- Place the magnet on a sheet of white paper fixed on a drawing board, using some adhesive material. 
- Mark the boundary of the magnet. 
- Place the compass ear the orth pole of the magnet. How does it behave? The south pole of the eedle points towards the orth pole of the magnet. The orth pole of the compass is directed away from the orth pole of the magnet.  Magnetic Effects of Electric Current 119Magnetic field is a quantity that has both direction and magnitude. The direction of the magnetic field is taken to be the direction in which a orth pole of the compass eedle moves inside it.  Therefore it is taken by convention that the field lines emerge from orth pole and merge at the south pole ( note the arrows marked on the field lines in Fig. 13.4). Inside the magnet, the direction of field lines is from its south pole to its orth pole. Thus the magnetic field lines are closed curves. The relative strength of the magnetic field is shown by the degree of closeness of the field lines. The field is str onger , that is, the for ce acting on the pole of another magnet placed is greater where the field lines are crowded (see Fig. 13.4). No two fieldlines ar e found to cr oss each other . If they did, it would mean that at the point of intersection, the compass eedle would point towards two directions, which is not possible. 13.2

In order to find the direction of the field produced let us repeat the activity in the following way Figure 13.3 Drawing a magnetic field line with the help of a compass eedlenMark the position of two ends of the eedle. 

- Now move the eedle to a ew position such that its south pole occupies the position previously occupied by its orth pole. 
- In this way, proceed step by step till you reach the south pole of the magnet as shown in Fig. 13.3. 
- Join the points marked on the paper by a smooth curve.  This curve represents a field line. 
- Repeat the above procedure and draw as many lines as you can. Y ou will get a pattern shown in Fig. 13.4. These lines represent the magnetic field around the magnet. These are known as magnetic field lines. 
- Observe the deflection in the compass eedle as you move it along a field line. The deflection increases as the eedle is moved towards the poles. Figure 13.4Figure 

13.4 Field lines around a bar magnet  12013.2.1 Magnetic Field due to a Current through a Straight Conductor What determines the pattern of the magnetic field generated by a current through a conductor? Does the pattern depend on the shape of the conductor? W e shall investigate this with an activity. We shall first consider the patter of the magnetic field ar ound a straight conductor carrying current.Activity 13.4 Take a long straight copper wire, two or three cells of 1.5 V each, and a plug key. Connect all of them in series as shown in Fig. 13.5 (a). 

- Place the straight wire parallel to and over a compass eedle. 
- Plug the key in the circuit. 
- Observe the direction of deflection of the orth pole of the eedle. If the current flows from orth to south, as shown in Fig. 13.5 (a), the orth pole of the compass eedle would move towards the east. 
- Replace the cell connections in the circuit as shown in Fig. 13.5 (b). This would result in the change of the direction of current through the copper wire, that is, from south to orth. 
- Observe the change in the dir ection of deflection of the eedle. Y ou will see that ow the eedle moves in opposite direction, that is, towards the west [Fig. 13.5 (b)]. It means that the direction of magnetic field produced by the electric current is also reversed. Figure 13.5Figure 

13.5 A simple electric circuit in which a straight copper wire is placed parallel to and over a compass eedle. The deflection in the eedle becomes opposite when the direction of the current is reversed.(a) (b) Activity 13.5 Take a battery (12 V), a variable resistance (or a rheostat), an ammeter (0 5 A), a plug key, connecting wires and a long straight thick copper wire. 

- Insert the thick wire through the centre, 
- ormal to the plane of a rectangular cardboard.  Take care that the cardboard is fixed and does not slide up or down.  Magnetic Effects of Electric Current 121What happens to the deflection of the compass eedle placed at a given point if the current in the copper wire is changed? To see this, vary the curr ent in the wir e. We find that the deflection in the eedle also changes. In fact, if the current is increased, the deflection also increases. It indicates that the magnitude of the magnetic field produced at a given point increases as the current through the wire increases. What happens to the deflection of the eedle if the compass is moved away from the copper wire but the current through the wire remains the same? To see this, 
- ow place the compass at a farther point from the conducting wir e (say at point Q). What change do you observe? W e see that the deflection in the eedle decreases. Thus the magnetic field produced by a given current in the conductor decreases as the distance from it increases. From Fig. 13.6, it can be noticed that the concentric circles representing the magnetic field around a currentcarrying straight wire become larger and larger as we move away from it.",

13.2.2 RightHand Thumb Rule": "A convenient way of finding the direction of magnetic field associated with a currentcarrying conductor i s given in Fig. 13.7.

- Connect the copper wire vertically between the points X and Y, as shown in Fig. 13.6 (a), in series with the battery, a plug and key. 
- Sprinkle some iron filings uniformly on the cardboar d. (You may use a salt sprinkler for this purpose.) Keep the variable of the rheostat at a fixed position and note the current through the ammeter . 
- Close the key so that a current flows through the wire. Ensure that the copper wire placed between the points X and Y remains vertically straight. 
- Gently tap the cardboard a few times. Observe the patter of the ir on filings. Y ou would find that the iron filings align themselves showing a pattern of concentric circles around the copper wire (Fig. 13.6). 
- What do these concentric circles represent? They represent the magnetic field lines. 
- How can the direction of the magnetic field be found? Place a compass at a point (say P) over a circle. Observe the direction of the eedle. The direction of the orth pole of the compass eedle would give the direction of the field lines produced by the electric current through the straight wire at point P . Show the dir ection by an arrow. 
- Does the direction of magnetic field lines get reversed if the direction of current through the straight copper wire is reversed? Check it.

(b) A close up of the pattern obtained.(a) (b)Variable resistance  122Imagine that you are holding a currentcarrying straight conductor in your right hand such that the thumb points towards the direction of current. Then your fingers will wrap around the conductor in the direction of the field lines of the magnetic field, as shown in Fig. 13.7. This is known as the righthand thumb rule *. Example 13.1Example 13.1Example 

13.1 A current through a horizontal power line flows in east to west direction. What is the direction of magnetic field at a point directly below it and at a point directly above it? Solution SolutionSolution The current is in the eastwest direction. Applying the righthand thumb rule, we get that the magnetic field (at any point below or above the wire) turns clockwise in a plane perpendicular to the wire, when viewed from the east end, and anticlockwise, when viewed from the west end.Figure 13.7 Righthand thumb rule *This rule is also called Maxwell’s corkscrew rule. If we consider ourselves driving a corkscrew in the direction of the current, then the direction of the rotation of corkscrew is the direction of the magnetic field.13.2.3 Magnetic Field due to a Current through a Circular Loop We have so far observed the patter of the magnetic field lines produced around a currentcarrying straight wire. Suppose this straight wire is bent in the form of a circular loop and a current is passed through it. How would the magnetic field lines look like? W e know that the magnetic field pr oduced by a currentcarrying straight wire depends inversely on the distance from it. Similarly at every point of a currentcarrying circular loop, the concentric circles representing the magnetic field around it would become larger and larger as we move away from the wire (Fig. 13.8). By the time we reach at the centre of the circular loop, the arcs of these big circles would appear as straight lines. Every point on the wire carrying current would give rise to the magnetic field appearing as straight lines at the center of the loop. By applying the right hand rule, it is easy to check that every section of the wire contributes to the magnetic field lines in the same direction within the loop.Figure 13.8 Magnetic field lines of the field produced by a currentcarrying circular loop?QUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONS 1. Draw magnetic field lines around a bar magnet. 2. List the properties of magnetic field lines. 3. Why don’t two magnetic field lines intersect each other?  Magnetic Effects of Electric Current 123We know that the magnetic field pr oduced by a curr entcarrying wire at a given point depends directly on the current passing through it. Therefore, if there is a circular coil having turns, the field produced is times as large as that produced by a single turn. This is because the current in each circular turn has the same direction, and the field due to each turn then just adds up. Activity 13.6 Take a rectangular cardboard having two holes. Insert a circular coil having large umber of turns through them,

13.2.4 Magnetic Field due to a Current in Solenoid": "A coil of many circular turns of insulated copper wire wrapped closely in the shape of a cylinder is called a solenoid. The pattern of the magnetic field lines around a currentcarrying solenoid is shown in Fig. 13.10. Compare the pattern of the field with the magnetic field around a bar magnet (Fig. 13.4). Do they look similar? Y es, they ar e similar . In fact, one end of the solenoid behaves as a magnetic orth pole, while the other behaves as the south pole. The field lines inside the solenoid are in the form of parallel straight lines. This indicates that the magnetic field is the same at all points inside the solenoid. That is, the field is uniform inside the solenoid. A strong magnetic field produced inside a solenoid can be used to magnetise a piece of magnetic material, like soft iron, when placed inside the coil (Fig. 13.11). The magnet so formed is called an electromagnet.Figure 13.10 Field lines of the magnetic field through and around a current carrying solenoid.

French scientist Andr e Marie Ampere (1775 1836) suggested that the magnet must also exert an equal and opposite for ce on the curr entcarrying conductor . The for ce due to a magnetic field acting on a currentcarrying conductor can be demonstrated through the following activity.3. Choose the correct option. The magnetic field inside a long straight solenoidcarrying current (a) is zero. (b) decreases as we move towards its end. (c) increases as we move towards its end. (d) is the same at all points. Activity 13.7 Take a small aluminium rod AB (of about 5 cm). Using two connecting wires suspend it horizontally from a stand, as shown in Fig. 13.12. 

- Place a strong horseshoe magnet in such a way that the rod lies between the two poles with the magnetic field directed upwards. For this put the orth pole of the magnet vertically below and south pole vertically above the aluminium rod (Fig. 13.12). 
- Connect the aluminium rod in series with a battery, a key and a rheostat. 
- Now pass a current through the aluminium rod from end B to end A. 
- What do you observe? It is observed that the rod is displaced towar ds the left. Y ou will notice that the r od gets displaced. 
- Reverse the direction of current flowing through the rod and observe the direction of its displacement. It is ow towards the right. Why does the rod get displaced?Figure 13.12Figure 

13.12 A currentcarrying rod, AB, experiences a force perpendicular to its length and the magnetic field. Support for the magnet is not shown here, for simplicity. The displacement of the rod in the above activity suggests that a force is exerted on the currentcarrying aluminium rod when it is placed in a magnetic field. It also suggests that the direction of force is also reversed when the direction of current through the conductor is reversed. Now change the direction of field to vertically downwards by interchanging the two poles of the magnet. It is once again observed that  Magnetic Effects of Electric Current 125the direction of force acting on the currentcarrying rod gets reversed. It shows that the direction of the force on the conductor depends upon the direction of current and the direction of the magnetic field. Experiments have shown that the displacement of the rod is largest (or the magnitude of the force is the highest) when the direction of current is at right angles to the direction of the magnetic field. In such a condition we can use a simple rule to find the dir ection of the for ce on the conductor . In Activity 13.7, we considered the direction of the current and that of the magnetic field perpendicular to each other and found that the force is perpendicular to both of them. The three directions can be illustrated through a simple rule, called Fleming’s lefthand rule. According to this rule, stretch the thumb, forefinger and middle finger of your left hand such that they are mutually perpendicular (Fig. 13.13). If the first finger points in the direction of magnetic field and the second finger in the direction of current, then the thumb will point in the direction of motion or the for ce acting on the conductor . Devices that use currentcarrying conductors and magnetic fields include electric motor , electric generator , loudspeakers, micr ophones and measuring instruments. In the ext few sections we shall study about electric motors and generators. Example 13.2Example 13.2Example 13.2 An electron enters a magnetic field at right angles to it, as shown in Fig. 13.14.

The direction of force is perpendicular to the direction of magnetic field and current as given by Fleming’s left hand rule. Recall that the direction of current is taken opposite to the direction of motion of electrons. The force is therefore directed into the page.Figure 13.13 Fleming’s lefthand rule Figure 13.14 QUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONS ?1.

Even weak ion currents that travel along the erve cells in our body produce magnetic fields. When we touch something, our erves carry an electric impulse to the muscles we eed to use. This impulse produces a temporary magnetic field. These fields are very weak and are about onebillionth of the earth’s magnetic field. Two main organs in the human body where the magnetic field produced is significant , are the heart and the brain. The magnetic field inside the body forms the basis of obtaining the images of different body parts. This is done using a technique called Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Analysis of these images helps in medical diagnosis. Magnetism has, thus, got important uses in medicine.",

13.4 ELECTRICMOTOR13.4 MOTOR": "An electric motor is a rotating device that converts electrical energy to mechanical energy. Electric motor is used as an important component in electric fans, refrigerators, mixers, washing machines, computers, MP3 players etc. Do you know how an electric motor works? An electric motor , as shown in Fig. 13.15, consists of a r ectangular coil ABCD of insulated copper wire. The coil is placed between the two poles of a magnetic field  such that the arm AB and CD are perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field. The ends of the coil are connected to the two halves P and Q of a split ring. The inner sides of these halves are insulated and attached to an axle. The external conducting edges of P and Q touch two conducting stationary brushes X and Y, respectively, as shown in the Fig. 13.15. Current in the coil ABCD enters from the source battery through conducting brush X and flows back to the battery through brush Y . Notice that the current in ar m AB of the coil flows from A to B. In arm CD it flows from C to D, that is, opposite to the direction of current through arm AB. On applying Fleming’s left hand rule for the direction of force on a currentcarryingFigure 13.15 A simple electric motor More to Know! N  Magnetic Effects of Electric Current 127conductor in a magnetic field (see Fig. 13.13). W e find that the for ce acting on arm AB pushes it downwards while the force acting on arm CD pushes it upwards. Thus the coil and the axle O, mounted free to turn about an axis, rotate anticlockwise. At half rotation, Q makes contact with the brush X and P with brush Y . Ther efore the curr ent in the coil gets reversed and flows along the path DCBA. A device that reverses the direction of flow of current through a circuit is called a commutator . In electric motors, the split ring acts as a commutator . The reversal of current also reverses the direction of force acting on the two arms AB and CD. Thus the arm AB of the coil that was earlier pushed down is ow pushed up and the arm CD previously pushed up is ow pushed down. Therefore the coil and the axle rotate half a turn more in the same direction. The reversing of the current is repeated at each half rotation, giving rise to a continuous rotation of the coil and to the axle. The commercial motors use (i) an electromagnet in place of permanent magnet; (ii) large umber of turns of the conducting wire in the currentcarrying coil; and (iii) a soft iron core on which the coil is wound. The soft iron core, on which the coil is wound, plus the coils, is called an armatur e. This enhances the power of the motor . Activity 13.8QUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONS ?1.

13.5 ELECTROMAGNETICINDUCTION13.5 INDUCTION": "We have studied that when a curr entcarrying conductor is placed in a magnetic field such that the direction of current is perpendicular to the magnetic field, it experiences a force. This force causes the conductor to move. Now let us imagine a situation in which a conductor is moving inside a magnetic field or a magnetic field is changing around a fixed conductor . What will happen? This was first studied by English physicist Michael Faraday. In 1831, Faraday made an important breakthrough by discovering how a moving magnet can be used to generate electric currents. To observe this effect, let us perform the following activity. 

- Take a coil of wire AB having a large umber of turns. 
- Connect the ends of the coil to a galvanometer as shown in Fig. 13.16. 
- Take a strong bar magnet and move its orth pole towards the end B of the coil. Do you find any change in the galvanometer eedle?  128nThere is a momentary deflection in the eedle of the galvanometer , say to the right. This indicates the presence of a current in the coil AB. The deflection becomes zero the moment the motion of the magnet stops. 
- Now withdraw the orth pole of the magnet away from the coil. Now the galvanometer is deflected toward the left, showing that the current is ow set up in the direction opposite to the first. 
- Place the magnet stationary at a point ear to the coil, keeping its orth pole towards the end B of the coil. W e see that the galvanometer eedle deflects toward the right when the coil is moved towards the orth pole of the magnet. Similarly the eedle moves toward left when the coil is moved away. 
- When the coil is kept stationary with respect to the magnet, the deflection of the galvanometer drops to zero. What do you conclude from this activity?Figure 13.16Figure 

13.16 Moving a magnet towards a coil sets up a current in the coil circuit, as indicated by deflection in the galvanometer eedle. A galvanometer is an instrument that can detect the presence of a current in a circuit. The pointer remains at zero (the centre of the scale) for zero current flowing through it. It can deflect either to the left or to the right of the zero mark depending on the direction of current. You can also check that if you had moved south pole of the magnet towards the end B of the coil, the deflections in the galvanometer would just be opposite to the previous case. When the coil and the magnet are both stationary, ther e is o deflection in the galvanometer . It is, thus, clear from this activity that motion of a magnet with respect to the coil produces an induced potential difference, which sets up an induced electric current in the circuit. Michael Faraday (1791 1867)Michael Faraday (1791 1867)Michael Faraday (1791 1867)Michael Faraday (1791 1867)Michael Faraday (1791 1867) Michael Faraday was an experimental physicist. He had o formal education. He worked in a bookbinding shop during his early years. He used to read books that came for binding. This way Faraday developed his interest in science. He got an opportunity to listen to some public lectures by Humphrey Davy of Royal Institute. He made careful notes of Davy’s lectures and sent them to Davy. Soon he was made an assistant in Davy’s laboratory at the Royal Institute. Faraday made several pathbreaking discoveries that include electromagnetic induction and the laws of electrolysis. Several universities conferred on him the honorary degrees but he turned down such honours. Faraday loved his science work mor e than any honour .  Magnetic Effects of Electric Current 129Let us ow perform a variation of Activity 13.8 in which the moving magnet is replaced by a currentcarrying coil and the current in the coil can be varied. Activity 13.9 Take two different coils of copper wire having large umber of turns (say 50 and 100 turns respectively). Insert them over a onconducting cylindrical r oll, as shown in Fig. 13.17. (Y ou may use a thick paper roll for this purpose.) Connect the coil1, having larger umber of turns, in series with a battery and a plug key. Also connect the other coil2 with a galvanometer as shown. 

- Plug in the key. Observe the galvanometer . Is there a deflection in its eedle? Y ou will observe that the eedle of the galvanometer instantly jumps to one side and just as quickly returns to zero, indicating a momentary current in coil2. 
- Disconnect coil1 fr om the battery. Y ou will observe that the eedle momentarily moves, but to the opposite side. It means that ow the current flows in the opposite direction in coil2. In this activity we observe that as soon as the current in coil1 reaches either a steady value or zero, the galvanometer in coil2 shows o deflection. From these observations, we conclude that a potential difference is induced in the coil2 whenever the electric current through the coil 1 is changing (starting or stopping). Coil1 is called the primary coil and coil2 is called the secondary coil. As the current in the first coil changes, the magnetic field associated with it also changes. Thus the magnetic field lines around the secondary coil also change. Hence the change in magnetic field lines associated with the secondary coil is the cause of induced electric current in it. This process, by which a changing magnetic field in a conductor induces a curr ent in another conductor , is called electromagnetic induction. In practice we can induce current in a coil either by moving it in a magnetic field or by changing the magnetic field around it. It is convenient in most situations to move the coil in a magnetic field. The induced current is found to be the highest when the direction of motion of the coil is at right angles to the magnetic field. In this situation, we can use a simple rule to know the direction of the induced current. Stretch the thumb, forefinger and middle finger of right hand so that they ar e perpendicular to each other , as shown in Fig. 13.18. If the forefinger indicates the direction of the magnetic field and the thumb shows the direction of motion of conductor , then the middle finger will show the dir ection of induced current. This simple rule is called Fleming’s righthand rule.Figure 13.18Figure 

13.18 Fleming’s righthand ruleFigure 13.17 Current is induced in coil2 when current in coil1 is changed  13013.6 ELECTRICGENER13.6 ELECTRICGENER13.6 ELECTRICGENER13.6 ELECTRICGENER13.6 ELECTRICGENERAAAAATORTORTORBased on the phenomenon of electromagnetic induction, the experiments studied above generate induced current, which is usually very small. This principle is also employed to produce large currents for use in homes and industry. In an electric generator , mechanical ener gy is used to r otate a conductor in a magnetic field to produce electricity. An electric generator , as shown in Fig. 13.19, consists of a r otating rectangular coil ABCD placed between the two poles of a permanent magnet. The two ends of this coil are connected to the two rings R1 and R2. The inner side of these rings are made insulated. The two conducting stationary brushes B1 and B2 are kept pressed separately on the rings R1 and R2, respectively. The two rings R1 and R2 are internally attached to an axle. The axle may be mechanically rotated from outside to rotate the coil inside the magnetic field. Outer ends of the two brushes are connected to the galvanometer to show the flow of current in the given external circuit. When the axle attached to the two rings is rotated such that the arm AB moves up (and the arm CD moves down) in the magnetic field produced by the permanent magnet. Let us say the coil ABCD is rotated clockwise in the arrangement shown in Fig. 13.19. By applying Fleming’s righthand rule, the induced currents are set up in these arms along the directions AB and CD. Thus an induced current flows in the direction ABCD. If there are larger umbers of turns in the coil, the current generated in each turn adds up to give a large current through the coil. This means that the current in the external circuit flows from B2 to B1. After half a rotation, arm CD starts moving up and AB moving down. As a result, the directions of the induced currents in both the arms change, giving rise to the et induced current in the direction DCBA. The current in the external circuit ow flows from B1 to B2. Thus after every half rotation the polarity of the current in the respective arms changes. Such a current, which changes direction after equal intervals of time, is called an alternating current (abbreviated as AC). This device is called an AC generator . To get a direct current (DC, which does not change its direction with time), a splitring type commutator must be used. With this arrangement, one brush is at all times in contact with the arm moving up in the field, while the other is in contact with the ar m moving down. W e have seen the working of a split ring commutator in the case of an electric motorQUESTIONQUESTIONQUESTIONQUESTIONQUESTION ?1. Explain different ways to induce current in a coil. Figure 13.19 Illustration of the principle of electric generator  Magnetic Effects of Electric Current 131(see Fig. 13.15). Thus a unidirectional current is produced. The generator is thus called a DC generator . The difference between the direct and alternating currents is that the direct current always flows in one direction, whereas the alternating current reverses its direction periodically. Most power stations constructed these days produce AC. In India, the AC changes direction after every 1/100 second, that is, the frequency of AC is 50 Hz. An important advantage of AC over DC is that electric power can be transmitted over long distances without much loss of energy. QUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONS ?1.

13.7 DOMESTICELECTRICCIRCUITS13.7 CIRCUITS": "In our homes, we receive supply of electric power through a main supply (also called mains), either supported through overhead electric poles or by underground cables. One of the wires in this supply, usually with red insulation cover , is called live wir e (or positive). Another wir e, with black insulation, is called eutral wire (or egative). In our country, the potential dif ference between the two is 220 V . At the meter boar d in the house, these wir es pass into an electricity meter through a main fuse. Through the main switch they are connected to the line wires in the house. These wires supply electricity to separate circuits within the house. Often, two separate circuits are used, one of 15 A current rating for appliances with higher power ratings such as geysers, air coolers, etc. The other circuit is of 5 A current rating for bulbs, fans, etc. The earth wir e, which has insulation of gr een colour , is usually connected to a metal plate deep in the earth ear the house. This is used as a safety measure, especially for those appliances that have a metallic body, for example, electric pr ess, toaster , table fan, refrigerator , etc. The metallic body is connected to the earth wir e, which provides a lowresistance conducting path for the current. Thus, it ensures that any leakage of current to the metallic body of the appliance keeps its potential to that of the earth, and the user may not get a severe electric shock.  132Figure 13.20 gives a schematic diagram of one of the common domestic circuits. In each separate circuit, different appliances can be connected across the live and eutral wires. Each appliance has a separate switch to ‘ON’/‘OFF’ the flow of current through it. In order that each appliance has equal potential difference, they are connected parallel to each other . Electric fuse is an important component of all domestic cir cuits. W e have already studied the principle and working of a fuse in the previous chapter (see Section 12.7). A fuse in a circuit prevents damage to the appliances and the circuit due to overloading. Overloading can occur when the live wire and the eutral wire come into direct contact. (This occurs when the insulation of wires is damaged or there is a fault in the appliance.) In such a situation, the current in the circuit abruptly increases. This is called shortcircuiting. The use of an electric fuse prevents the electric circuit and the appliance from a possible damage by stopping the flow of unduly high electric current. The Joule heating that takes place in the fuse melts it to break the electric circuit. Overloading can also occur due to an accidental hike in the supply voltage. Sometimes overloading is caused by connecting too many appliances to a single socket.Figure 13.20  A schematic diagram of one of the common domestic circuits QUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONS ?1. Name two safety measures commonly used in electric circuits and appliances. 2. An electric oven of 2 kW power rating is operated in a domestic electric circuit (220 V) that has a current rating of 5 A. What result do you expect? Explain. 3. What precaution should be taken to avoid the overloading of domestic electric circuits?  Magnetic Effects of Electric Current 133What y ou hav e learnt A compass eedle is a small magnet. Its one end, which points towards orth, is called a orth pole, and the other end, which points towards south, is called a south pole. 

- A magnetic field exists in the region surrounding a magnet, in which the force of the magnet can be detected. 
- Field lines are used to represent a magnetic field. A field line is the path along which a hypothetical free orth pole would tend to move. The direction of the magnetic field at a point is given by the direction that a orth pole placed at that point would take. Field lines are shown closer together where the magnetic field is greater. 
- A metallic wire carrying an electric current has associated with it a magnetic field. The field lines about the wire consist of a series of concentric circles whose direction is given by the righthand rule. 
- The pattern of the magnetic field around a conductor due to an electric current flowing thr ough it depends on the shape of the conductor . The magnetic field of a solenoid carrying a current is similar to that of a bar magnet. 
- An electromagnet consists of a core of soft iron wrapped around with a coil of insulated copper wire. 
- A currentcarrying conductor when placed in a magnetic field experiences a force. If the direction of the field and that of the current are mutually perpendicular to each other , then the for ce acting on the conductor will be perpendicular to both and will be given by Fleming’s lefthand rule. This is the basis of an electric motor . An electric motor is a device that converts electric energy into mechanical energy. 
- The phenomenon of electromagnetic induction is the production of induced current in a coil placed in a region where the magnetic field changes with time. The magnetic field may change due to a relative motion between the coil and a magnet placed ear to the coil. If the coil is placed ear to a curr entcarrying conductor , the magnetic field may change either due to a change in the current through the conductor or due to the r elative motion between the coil and conductor . The direction of the induced current is given by the Fleming’s righthand rule. 
- A generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. It works on the basis of electromagnetic induction. 
- In our houses we receive AC electric power of 

220 V with a frequency of 50 Hz. One of the wires in this supply is with red insulation, called live wire. The other one is of black insulation, which is a eutral wire. The potential difference between the two is 220 V . The thir d is the earth wir e that has gr een insulation and this is connected to a metallic body deep inside earth. It is used as a safety measure to ensure that any leakage of curr ent to a metallic body does not give any sever e shock to a user . 

- Fuse is the most important safety device, used for protecting the circuits due to shortcircuiting or overloading of the circuits.  134EXERCISES 1.Which of the following correctly describes the magnetic field ear a long straight wire?

15 CHAPTER We have heard the wor d ‘envir onment’ often being used on the television, in ewspapers and by people around us. Our elders tell us that the ‘environment’ is not what it used to be earlier; others say that we should work in a healthy ‘environment’; and global summits involving the developed and developing countries are regularly held to discuss ‘envir onmental’ issues. In this chapter , we shall be studying how various components in the environment interact with each other and how we impact the environment.",

        "

15.1 ECO 15.1 SYSTEM — WHASYSTEM WHA T ARE ITS COMPONENTS?T COMPONENTS?": "All organisms such as plants, animals, microorganisms and human beings as well as the physical surroundings interact with each other and maintain a balance in ature. All the interacting organisms in an area together with the onliving constituents of the environment form an ecosystem. Thus, an ecosystem consists of biotic components comprising living organisms and abiotic components comprising physical factors like temperature, rainfall, wind, soil and minerals. For example, if you visit a garden you will find different plants, such as grasses, trees; flower bearing plants like rose, jasmine, sunflower; and animals like frogs, insects and birds. All these living organisms interact with each other and their growth, reproduction and other activities are affected by the abiotic components of ecosystem. So a garden is an ecosystem. Other types of ecosystems are forests, ponds and lakes. These are atural ecosystems while gardens and cropfields are humanmade (artificial) ecosystems. 

- You might have seen an aquarium. Let us try to design one. 
- What are the things that we eed to keep in mind when we create an aquarium? The fish would eed a free space for swimming (it could be a large jar), water , oxygen and food. 
- We can pr ovide oxygen thr ough an oxygen pump (aerator) and fish food which is available in the market.  Our Environment 137nIf we add a few aquatic plants and animals it can become a selfsustaining system. Can you think how this happens? An aquarium is an example of a humanmade ecosystem. 
- Can we leave the aquarium as such after we set it up? Why does it have to be cleaned once in a while? Do we have to clean ponds or lakes in the same manner? Why or why not? We have seen in earlier classes that or ganisms can be gr ouped as producers, consumers and decomposers according to the manner in which they obtain their sustenance from the environment. Let us recall what we have learnt through the self sustaining ecosystem created by us above. Which organisms can make organic compounds like sugar and starch from inorganic substances using the radiant energy of the Sun in the presence of chlorophyll? All green plants and certain bacteria which can produce food by photosynthesis come under this category and are called the producers. Organisms depend on the producers either directly or indirectly for their sustenance? These organisms which consume the food produced, either directly from producers or indirectly by feeding on other consumers are the consumers. Consumers can be classed variously as herbivores, carnivores, omnivores and parasites. Can you give examples for each of these categories of consumers? 
- Imagine the situation where you do not clean the  aquarium and some fish and plants have died. Have you ever thought what happens when an organism dies? The microorganisms, comprising bacteria and fungi, breakdown the dead remains and waste products of organisms. These microorganisms are the decomposers as they breakdown the complex organic substances into simple inorganic substances that go into the soil and are used up once more by the plants. What will happen to the garbage, and dead animals and plants in their absence? Will the atural replenishment of the soil take place, even if decomposers are not there? Activity 15.2 While creating an aquarium did you take care not to put an aquatic animal which would eat others? What would have happened otherwise? 
- Make groups and discuss how each of the above groups of organisms ar e dependent on each other . 
- Write the aquatic or ganisms in or der of who eats whom and for m a chain of at least three steps.   
- Would you consider any one gr oup of organisms to be of primary importance? Why or why not?  138Figure 15.2Figure 

15.2 Trophic levels15.1.1 F ood Chains and W ebs In Activity 15.4 we have formed a series of organisms feeding on one another . This series or ganisms taking part at various biotic levels form a food chain (Fig. 15.1). Each step or level of the food chain forms a trophic level. The autotrophs or the producers are at the first trophic level. They fix up the solar energy and make it available for heterotrophs or the consumers. The herbivores or the primary consumers come at the second, small carnivores or the secondary consumers at the third and larger carnivores or the tertiary consumers form the fourth trophic level (Fig. 15.2). We know that the food we eat acts as a fuel to pr ovide us energy to do work. Thus the interactions among various components of the environment involves flow of energy from one component of the system to another . As we have studied, the autotrophs capture the energy present in sunlight and convert it into chemical energy. This energy supports all the activities of the living world. From autotrophs, the energy goes to the heter otrophs and decomposers. However , as we saw in the previous Chapter on ‘Sources of Energy’, when one form of ener gy is changed to another , some ener gy is lost to the environment in forms which cannot be used again. The flow of energy between various components of the environment has been extensively studied and it has been found that – 

- The green plants in a terrestrial ecosystem capture about 1% of the energy of sunlight that falls on their leaves and convert it into food energy. 
- When green plants are eaten by primary consumers, a great deal of energy is lost as heat to the environment, some amount goes into digestion and in doing work and the rest goes towards growth and reproduction. An average of 10% of the food eaten is turned into its own body and made available for the ext level of consumers. 
- Therefore, 10% can be taken as the average value for the amount of organic matter that is present at each step and reaches the ext level of consumers. 
- Since so little energy is available for the ext level of consumers, food chains generally consist of only three or four steps. The loss of energy at each step is so great that very little usable energy remains after four trophic levels. 
- There are generally a greater umber of individuals at the lower trophic levels of an ecosystem, the greatest umber is of the producers. 
- The length and complexity of food chains vary greatly. Each organism is generally eaten by two or more other kinds of organisms which in turn are eaten by several other organisms. So instead of a straight line food chain, the relationship can be shown as a series of branching lines called a food web (Fig. 15.3).Figure 15.1Figure 

15.1 Food chain in ature (a) in forest, (b) in grassland and (c) in a pond  Our Environment 139From the energy flow diagram (Fig. 15.4), two things become clear . Firstly, the flow of energy is unidirectional. The energy that is captured by the autotrophs does not revert back to the solar input and the energy which passes to the herbivores does not come back to autotrophs. As it moves progressively through the various trophic levels it is o longer available to the previous level. Secondly, the energy available at each trophic level gets diminished progressively due to loss of energy at each level. Another interesting aspect of food chain is how unknowingly some harmful chemicals enter our bodies through the food chain. Y ou have r ead in Class IX how water gets polluted. One of the reasons is the use of several pesticides and other chemicals to protect our crops from diseases and pests. These chemicals are either washed down into the soil or into the water bodies. From the soil, these are absorbed by the plants along with water and minerals, and from the water bodies these are taken up by aquatic plants Figure 15.4  Diagram showing flow of energy in an ecosystemFigure 15.3 Food web, consisting of many food chains  140Activity 15.3and animals. This is one of the ways in which they enter the food chain. As these chemicals are not degradable, these get accumulated progressively at each trophic level. As human beings occupy the top level in any food chain, the maximum concentration of these chemicals get accumulated in our bodies. This phenomenon is known as biological magnification. This is the reason why our food grains such as wheat and rice, vegetables and fruits, and even meat, contain varying amounts of pesticide residues. They cannot always be removed by washing or other means. QUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONS ?1. What are trophic levels?

15.2.1 Ozone Layer and How it is Getting Depleted": "Ozone (O3) is a molecule formed by three atoms of oxygen. While O2, which we ormally refer to as oxygen, is essential for all aerobic forms of life. Ozone, is a deadly poison. However , at the higher levels of the atmosphere, ozone performs an essential function. It shields the surface of the earth from ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun. This radiationnNewspaper reports about pesticide levels in readymade food items are often seen these days and some states have banned these products. Debate in groups the eed for such bans. 

- What do you think would be the source of pesticides in these food items? Could pesticides get into our bodies from this source through other food products too? 
- Discuss what methods could be applied to reduce our intake of pesticides.  Our Environment 141Activity 15.5Activity 15.4is highly damaging to organisms, for example, it is known to cause skin cancer in human beings. Ozone at the higher levels of the atmosphere is a product of UV radiation acting on oxygen (O2) molecule. The higher energy UV radiations split apart some moleculer oxygen (O2) into free oxygen (O) atoms. These atoms then combine with the molecular oxygen to form ozone as shown— O +O2UV  O O2 

3 Oz one)+ ( The amount of ozone in the atmosphere began to drop sharply in the 1980s. This decrease has been linked to synthetic chemicals like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which are used as refrigerants and in fire extinguishers. In 1987, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) succeeded in forging an agreement to freeze CFC production at 1986 levels. It is ow mandatory for all the manufacturing companies to make CFCfree refrigerators throughout the world. 

- Collect waste material from your homes. This could include all the waste generated during a day, like kitchen waste (spoilt food, vegetable peels, used tea leaves, milk packets and empty cartons), waste paper , empty medicine bottles/strips/bubble packs, old and torn clothes and br oken footwear . 
- Bury this material in a pit in the school garden or if there is o space available, you can collect the material in an old bucket/ flower pot and cover with at least 15 cm of soil. 
- Keep this material moist and observe at 15day intervals. 
- What are the materials that remain unchanged over long periods of time? 
- What are the materials which change their form and structure over time? 
- Of these materials that are changed, which ones change the fastest?
- Find out from the library, internet or ewspaper reports, which chemicals ar e responsible for the depletion of the ozone layer . 
- Find out if the regulations put in place to control the emission of these chemicals have succeeded in reducing the damage to the ozone layer . Has the size of the hole in the ozone layer changed in recent years?",

15.2.2 Managing the Garbage we Produce": "In our daily activities, we generate a lot of material that are thrown away. What are some of these waste materials? What happens after we throw them away? Let us perform an activity to find answers to these questions.  142We have seen in the chapter on ‘Life Pr ocesses’ that the food we eat is digested by various enzymes in our body. Have you ever wondered why the same enzyme does not breakdown everything we eat? Enzymes are specific in their action, specific enzymes are eeded for the breakdown of a particular substance. That is why we will not get any energy if we try to eat coal! Because of this, many humanmade materials like plastics will not be broken down by the action of bacteria or other saprophytes. These materials will be acted upon by physical processes like heat and pressure, but under the ambient conditions found in our environment, these persist for a long time. Substances that are broken down by biological processes are said to be biodegradable. How many of the substances you buried were biodegradable? Substances that are not broken down in this manner are said to be onbiodegradable. These substances may be inert and simply persist in the environment for a long time or may harm the various members of the ecosystem. Activity 15.6 Use the library or internet to find out more about biodegradable and onbiodegradable substances. 

- How long are various onbiodegradable substances expected to last in our environment? 
- These days, 
- ew types of plastics which are said to be biodegradable are available. Find out more about such materials and whether they do or do not harm the environment. 1. Why are some substances biodegradable and some onbiodegradable? 2. Give any two ways in which biodegradable substances would affect the environment. 3. Give any two ways in which onbiodegradable substances would affect the environment.QUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONS ? Visit any town or city, and we are sure to find heaps of garbage all over the place. Visit any place of tourist interest and we are sure to find the place littered with empty food wrappers. In the earlier classes we have talked about this problem of dealing with the garbage that we generate. Let us ow look at the problem a bit more deeply.  Our Environment 143Activity 15.7 Find out what happens to the waste generated at home. Is there a system in place to collect this waste? 
- Find out how the local body ( panchayat , municipal corporation, resident welfare association) deals with the waste. Are there mechanisms in place to treat the biodegradable and onbiodegradable wastes separately? 
- Calculate how much waste is generated at home in a day. 
- How much of this waste is biodegradable? 
- Calculate how much waste is generated in the classroom in a day. 
- How much of this waste is biodegradable? 
- Suggest ways of dealing with this waste. Improvements in our lifestyle have resulted in greater amounts of waste material generation. Changes in attitude also have a role to play, with more and more things we use becoming disposable. Changes in packaging have resulted in much of our waste becoming onbiodegradable. What do you think will be the impact of these on our environment?Activity 15.8 Find out how the sewage in your locality is treated. Are there mechanisms in place to ensure that local water bodies are not polluted by untreated sewage. 
- Find out how the local industries in your locality treat their wastes. Are there mechanisms in place to ensure that the soil and water are not polluted by this waste? Disposable cups in trainsDisposable cups in trains If you ask your parents, they will probably remember a time when tea in trains was served in plastic glasses which had to be r eturned to the vendor . The intr oduction of disposable cups was hailed as a step forward for reasons of hygiene. No one at that time perhaps thought about the impact caused by the disposal of millions of these cups on a daily basis. Some time back, kulhads , that is, disposable cups made of clay, were suggested as an alternative. But a little thought showed that making these kulhads  on a large scale would result in the loss of the fertile topsoil. Now disposable paper cups are being used. What do you think ar e the advantages of disposable paper cups over disposable plastic cups?Think it overThink it overThink it over  144Activity 15.9 Search the internet or library to find out what hazardous materials have to be dealt with while disposing of electronic items. How would these materials affect the environment? 
- Find out how plastics are recycled. Does the recycling process have any impact on the environment? QUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONSQUESTIONS ?1. What is ozone and how does it affect any ecosystem? 2. How can you help in reducing the problem of waste disposal? Give any two methods. What y ou hav e learnt The various components of an ecosystem are interdependent. 
- The producers make the energy from sunlight available to the rest of the ecosystem. 
- There is a loss of energy as we go from one trophic level to the ext, this limits the umber of trophic levels in a foodchain. 
- Human activities have an impact on the environment. 
- The use of chemicals like CFCs has endanger ed the ozone layer . Since the ozone layer protects against the ultraviolet radiation from the Sun, this could damage the environment. 
- The waste we generate may be biodegradable or onbiodegradable. 
- The disposal of the waste we generate is causing serious environmental problems. EXERCISES 1.Which of the following groups contain only biodegradable items?
